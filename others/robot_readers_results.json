    "GPT_Result": "JJ Luangkhot is the executive chef and owner of JJ’s Bistro & French Pastry. He has been busy because he changed the name and idea of his second restaurant, which was called J2 Asian Fusion. Now, the restaurant on Waialae Avenue is named Le Cacao Bistro. Luangkhot says he made these changes early last month.\n\n“This is a new idea I’m bringing here. J2 Asian Fusion was like a Southeast Asian restaurant, but now Le Cacao Bistro is like a New York style bistro,” says Luangkhot, who is also the chef. “We are offering more steak, lamb rack, pork rack, pizza, pasta, and more. I think people enjoy this bistro style more than Asian fusion food.”\n\nThe new menu has dishes like Pork Rack with Herbal Mustard Cream Sauce for $14.95 and New York Steak for $18.95.\n\n“You see a lot of pork chops these days, but not a lot of pork rack,” says Luangkhot. The 8-ounce grilled pork rack has a special Dijon mustard and honey sauce, and it comes with vegetables and mashed potatoes.\n\n“We’re trying to give bigger portions,” he adds, saying the New York Steak is a good example. The 8-ounce steak is grilled and served with a black pepper, red wine sauce. It comes with vegetables and mashed potatoes, which will satisfy most diners. Seafood lovers will enjoy dishes like Grilled Salmon with Lemon Caper Butter Sauce for $12.95 and Lobster Brioche for $12.95. There are also options like Southeast Fettucini Seafood Pasta for $12.95 and Le Clam Fettucini for $12.95.\n\n“We’ve had a quick, positive reaction to the changes,\" says Luangkhot. \"Our famous desserts are here too, like gluten-free Warm Chocolate Cake for $5.50 and Sweet Corn Haupia Parfait for $5.50.”\n\nStarting next month, Le Cacao Bistro will offer afternoon tea for $14.95 per person from 2 to 5 p.m. every day.",

    "GPT_Result": "The disgraced sports star still loves to fight, but he mostly stopped cycling and spends much time on the golf course drinking \"Lanceritas.\"\nIt has been 18 months since Lance Armstrong confessed on TV to Oprah Winfrey about his doping, lying, and bullying during his cycling career.\nIn Esquire's latest issue, John H. Richardson interviews the disgraced athlete and cancer survivor. The article titled \"Lance Armstrong in Purgatory: The Afterlife\" shows Armstrong's smaller but still stubborn ego and how he deals with his fall from the top of sports to being mocked.\nPHOTOS Celebrities Behaving Badly: From Justin Bieber to Reese Witherspoon, Hollywood's Recent Mugshots\nHere are six surprising things from the interview. \n1) He plays golf now and seldom cycles \nArmstrong says he always hated golf but now plays it five times a week as he is mostly unemployed. Richardson writes: \"The game is not natural for him. You have to swivel your hips, and his legs were all about up and down. Now, he takes lessons, plays eighteen holes, then goes home to watch golf on TV. … Armstrong just shrugs. \"What else am I gonna do?\"\nEven more surprising, because he trained a lot in the past, is that he hardly cycles now.\n\"It's like, I don't really care,\" he says, feeling surprised. \"It's weird.\"\n2) He regrets the lying and bullying but still defends doping\n\"Up to today, Armstrong won't say sorry for doping in any forum. He seems sorry for lying and suing people who tried to reveal the truth, but he cannot say sorry for doping as people want.\"\nArmstrong insists he had a simple choice: cheat or go back to work at a bike shop in Austin. He mentions Michael Irvin, a Dallas Cowboys star, as inspiration: \"I mean, he was getting busted with strippers and cocaine and stuff. All the Cowboys were crazy. And he had this one great line: 'I'm gonna catch a touchdown this weekend and it's all good.'\"\nPHOTOS World Cup: 13 Sexy Soccer Players Stretching\n3) He calls his margaritas 'Lanceritas'\nIn the interviews, Armstrong orders, drinks, and makes his \"Lanceritas.\" Richardson does not share the recipe, but it seems Armstrong likes lime and crushed ice. When ordering more drinks, Armstrong tells a waiter: \"Keep the same ice, bro. I love crushed ice.\"\n4) He still gets criticized on Facebook even when doing something nice\nEven though he left the Livestrong foundation he started, Armstrong is still in touch with the cancer survivor community. He keeps a low profile now. When he posts on social media, he often gets criticized.\nAfter a close cancer victim died, he posted a heartfelt tribute on Facebook: \"RIP Jimmy Fowkes,\" it read. \"You have forever touched my life and millions of others. I will miss you. Jimmystrong….\"\nDespite the sad topic, he got negative comments: \"I'll bet he didn't cheat,\" said one comment.\nPHOTOS World Cup 2014: Top 11 Shocks and Surprises of the Tournament\n5) He still has a big ego (sometimes)\nIn the interview, he asks if Nelson Mandela really forgave people who jailed him for 27 years or just said so for the public.\nHe also compares himself many times to Bill Clinton, then admits he should not because it might sound \"too proud.\" So, he compares himself to other sports stars. \"People are fine if Michael Jordan was a jerk, they're fine if Wayne Gretzky was a jerk, but they weren't fine with me being a jerk. They expected a perfect story.\"\n6) He still matters to many cancer survivors\nThe article has stories from cancer survivors about personal messages they got from Armstrong and the important role he played in their recovery. Richardson also says Armstrong hosted a fundraiser for a camp for sick kids and hopes to make peace with Livestrong. While open or argumentative on many topics, when it comes to his work with the cancer survivor community, Armstrong seems to be more private. \"He will not talk about any of this, because he considers it inappropriate,\" Richardson writes.",

    "GPT_Result": "Two new NASA probes flying through the Earth's radiation belts found these areas change faster than scientists thought.  \nThe Van Allen Probes, which are twin spacecraft, launched on August 30 and turned on their instruments two days later.  \nSince then, the spacecraft have given amazing new measurements of the Van Allen radiation belts around Earth.  \nIn these zones, Earth's magnetic field traps trillions of high-energy particles from the sun.  \n\"We've all been amazed by the great results we've seen so early,\" said deputy project scientist Nikki Fox from Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory.  \nThe spacecraft have been orbiting for less than 100 days, but have already sent back a lot of data.  \nThese regions are hard to measure because their radiation is harmful to most probes, but the Van Allen Probes have strong aluminum shielding.  \nOne finding is that the conditions in the radiation belts change very quickly, with particles there varying more in energy, time, and space than scientists thought before.  \n\"We're seeing a much more dynamic and quickly changing outer radiation belt than we expected,\" said Daniel Baker, principal investigator from the University of Colorado, Boulder.  \nHe added, \"We're seeing patterns in space and time we didn't know about before.\"  \nThe spacecraft have also detected radio waves coming from Earth’s magnetosphere, which sound like \"alien birds.\"  \n\"You can hear chirps and cricket-like sounds,\" said Craig Kletzing, principal investigator from the University of Iowa.  \n\"This is a fantastic new measurement and we've never had this detail before.\"  \nThe Van Allen Probes mission is just starting and will last at least two years.  \nTheir findings will help explain this part of Earth's environment and could protect future spacecraft from radiation damage.  \n\"The Van Allen Probes mission will rewrite the way we describe Earth's environment before we launch new missions,\" said Joseph Mazur from the Aerospace Corporation.  \nFollow Clara Moskowitz on Twitter @ClaraMoskowitz or Space.com @Spacedotcom.  \nWe're also on Facebook and Google+.",

    "GPT_Result": "F.P. Report  \nPESHAWAR: Tempting and attractive advertisements about making money online could be a trap by cyber-criminals to steal from people, especially young people. Information technology (IT) experts have warned young people to take steps to make sure the process is safe and check the credibility of websites that promise income and profit from home. An expert from the Ministry of IT, who did not want to be named, explained the truths and myths of online earning to APP. He said, “One click doesn’t bring money; it needs skill, hard work, and patience.” But he lamented that the educated unemployed youth of the country are more targeted by internet crooks and asked for raising awareness among this vulnerable group.\n\nHe said the temptation usually comes from random sites, and unskilled people are more attracted because the job description is cleverly made by scammers to fit them. Interesting ads like “Make Rs 50,000 a month from home, just know how to use a computer” somehow attract unemployed young people. He regretted there is no national institution to create public awareness against these criminals, leaving vulnerable people, especially young people, at the mercy of scammers.\n\nHe mentioned that one could easily check if a site is credible by looking up their status on “alexa.com” and “domaintools.com,” which provide complete information about a website. “The good thing is a fake site does not have a security certificate because it is too expensive,” he added. Another software engineer, Attique ur Rehman, talked about different types of online earning and said, “It is a complex topic because real sites don't just need simple registration but ask for full user information. There are different types of online earning, like online trading, freelancing, and affiliate marketing.” He said earning through ads is the most popular way, as many people in Pakistan earn a lot with AdSense by using ads on their websites or YouTube channels, which also need consistency from the user.\n\nThe most popular among them is stock exchange business, but “expertise is necessary for online trading, and there is a high risk of losing money before logging into a real business entity,” he added. Attique warned that without proper knowledge and safety measures, starting this could cost a person financially. The scammers, he said, would ask for Rs 5,000 to 10,000 as a registration fee to start earning but would disappear and sometimes reappear with a different name as a new trick.\n\nAttique discussed the importance of blogging for the educated part of society and said, “One can sell their skills, especially writing, on the Internet to anyone worldwide by making their own blog, which increases earnings as their ranking goes up.” He said updating a profile based on client needs boosts ranking. Attique said that skilled unemployed youth could start earning with some training and boost the country's IT sector. However, he urged the authorities to introduce short courses and training on online earning, like in developed countries where the IT sector is the top revenue-generating area and helps their national economies.",

    "GPT_Result": "Some patients might see better without glasses with an implanted lens.\nSilver Spring, Maryland—(ENEWSPF)—November 22, 2017\nBy: Stephanie Caccomo\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the RxSight Inc. Light Adjustable Lens and Light Delivery Device. This is the first device that can change the power of an artificial lens after cataract surgery to improve vision without glasses.\nCataracts are a common eye problem where the natural lens gets cloudy and affects vision. After cataract surgery, the cloudy lens is replaced with an artificial one, but many patients still need glasses or contacts because of small vision errors. These errors happen when the lens does not focus right and causes blurry vision.\n“Before now, vision errors after cataract surgery could only be fixed with glasses, contact lenses, or more surgery,” said Malvina Eydelman, M.D., from the FDA. “This new system allows doctors to adjust the lens after surgery to improve vision without glasses.”\nThe RxSight lens is made of a special material that changes with UV light. Patients get three to four light treatments, 17-21 days after surgery, each taking 40-150 seconds. They must wear special glasses to protect the lens from UV light until treatments are finished.\nA study on 600 patients tested the safety and how well the RxSight lens works. Six months later, patients could see one more line down on an eye chart for distance vision without glasses, compared to regular lenses. Also, 75% had less astigmatism six months after surgery.\nThe device is for patients with astigmatism before surgery who don’t have macular diseases.\nPatients taking medicines that make them sensitive to UV light should not use this device. Such medicines include tetracycline, doxycycline, psoralens, and others. Using the device with these medicines could harm the eyes. It’s also not for people with herpes simplex virus in the eyes.\nThe FDA approved the Vision Light Adjustable Lens and Light Delivery Device for RxSight Inc.\nThe FDA works to keep people safe by checking that medicines, vaccines, and medical devices work and are secure. It also ensures the safety of food, cosmetics, dietary supplements, electronic products, and tobacco.\nSource: www.fda.gov",

    "GPT_Result": "Maybe the only thing easier to make than a sandwich is a salad. So when I wanted an easy sandwich for a party, I chose to make a Caesar salad and wrap it in Middle Eastern lavash bread. I thought that most people like Caesar salad, and the wrap-style made fun finger food.\nSince the sandwiches would sit out on a tray, I didn't want to use a traditional Caesar dressing with raw eggs. So I changed to a healthier recipe with buttermilk and light mayo. It was very easy, and the salad had a strong taste, unlike some other healthy Caesar salads I've tried. To get the recipe and for more photos, see below.\nChicken Caesar Wraps Ingredients: One dozen lavash wraps, 1 1/2 cups low-fat buttermilk, 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, 1 pressed garlic clove, 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, coarse salt and ground pepper, 6 to 8 ounces precooked grilled chicken breast strips, 1/4 cup light mayonnaise, 2 medium heads romaine lettuce (cut into pieces). Directions: In a medium bowl, mix buttermilk, lemon juice, garlic, and Parmesan. Add salt and pepper. In a large bowl, mix mayonnaise and buttermilk mixture. Add romaine and chicken; toss to mix. Put two lavash wraps at a time on a plate and cover with a wet paper towel. Microwave for 30 seconds to soften the lavash so it doesn't tear. As each lavash wrap comes out, place about 1/2 cup of salad mixture in the center of the wrap. Fold in the ends and roll up like a burrito. Cut the rolled wrap into three equal pieces. Pin each piece with a toothpick and serve on a platter. Information: Category: Main Dishes, Sandwiches Cuisine: Mediterranean/Middle Eastern",

    "GPT_Result": "AURORA | Aurora Public Schools got a low score from a state school-district rating system and will be in its fifth year of the “accountability clock,” according to the data released Thursday by the Colorado State Board of Education.  \nCherry Creek school district did better but was told off for low participation in statewide standardized tests.  \nThe state's accountability system, created under the Education Accountability Act of 2009, gives school districts a status based on academic achievement, growth, and readiness for college or work. APS got the second-lowest rating a school district can get, which is Accredited with Priority Improvement Plan. The official District Performance Framework report says APS is struggling most with academic achievement.  \n“Over the past few years, we have started an aggressive reform strategy to improve our lowest-performing schools,” said APS Superintendent Rico Munn. “We are seeing these reforms make a difference with many areas of growth and improvement, but we know that this growth is not happening fast enough. We will work to keep improving and focus on our strategic plan to help every APS student succeed in the future.”  \nIn November 2016, APS asked CDE to reconsider its rating and change it to Accredited with Improvement Plan, asking for some schools to be excluded from the data used to decide district performance. The request was denied.  \nNearby Cherry Creek School District did better than APS, earning the status of Accredited with Low Participation. Low participation was added to CCSD’s rating because test participation rates were below 95 percent in two or more areas, most likely because students chose not to take PARCC tests last year.  \n“We are pleased that we continue to make progress toward our goal of Accredited with Distinction. It shows that our hard work and focus on inclusive excellence and student success is taking us where we want to go,” said CCSD Superintendent Harry Bull. “Even so, we still have more work to do, and the information we get helps us know where we need to focus more.”",

    "GPT_Result": "Talk about shopping until you drop…Black Friday shoppers have nothing on the taxpayer-funded spending by some state agencies. \nGovernor Cuomo shared his budget plan for the new state fiscal year starting April 1st, so some state agencies and political leaders now rush to spend extra taxpayer money before a new budget is approved. \nThey spend your money not because the Governor and Legislature said they could, or because they need the items, but sometimes just because they have extra money. \nA state agency might have a little bit of money left at the end of the year and quickly spend it all. \nSoon this fast spending becomes a lot of money. This is more worrying because New York has a big budget deficit, maybe up to $10 billion. \nWe have all heard stories of unnecessary, wasteful government spending: hammers and toilet seats that cost governments hundreds of dollars, and $400,000 for \"Ghost Ship\" commissions that are no longer needed. \nThe spending is worst when the old Democratic Majority in the Senate spent at least $10 million extra on fancy office space and more staff and political appointees. \nAt the same time, the State University of New York at Albany faces big budget cuts, job losses, and possible tuition increases, yet gave out $1.2 million in \"discretionary\" raises at the year-end. \nThese two examples may be only a small part of the problem. \nThe $136.5 billion New York State budget is made up of many smaller state agency budgets. Think about this: there are more than 70 state agencies, 64 colleges in the State University of New York system, and 20 City University of New York campuses. \nThis is also including many public authorities with little oversight from the legislature or executive branch. Each of these can be split into smaller agencies, bureaus, and departments each with their own small budget. \nThat’s a lot of people handling taxpayer money. \nOften, state agencies fear that if they spend less, they will lose funding next year. So instead of saving taxpayer dollars, these agencies go on a shopping spree. \nState agencies that manage money well and only spend what they are allowed should be praised, not punished. Sadly, state government has developed a habit of spending first and asking if it is needed later. No wonder New York, as Governor Cuomo said, is “functionally bankrupt.” \nBecause of wild spending by state Senate Democrats and others, I am bringing in the O.U.T. (Over-Expenditure/Under-Expenditure/Transfer-Notification) of Debt Act to stop future taxpayer misuse. \nNew York’s government should stop end-of-year spending sprees. Many agencies try to use up their money at the end of the year to keep their budget. This creates and grows deficits. \nMy legislation would make sure all extra money goes to the general fund to pay debts or lower taxes. If state agencies do not follow this, the Comptroller must stop any unapproved spending or transfers. \nA state agency shouldn’t waste taxpayer money on hiring more political staff or buying many extra paper clips just because money is left. \nIf spending tax dollars at the last minute is important, then it should be approved by the elected officials who make the budget. \nThis is the taxpayers’ money and should be used to help pay off state debt and lower property taxes. \nThis bill won’t fix New York’s deficit by itself, but it will help show spending clearly and help save taxpayers from end-of-year spending sprees.",

    "GPT_Result": "Former mob boss and fugitive James \"Whitey\" Bulger is seen in a police photo released on August 1, 2011.\n(Note: Paragraph 15 has language that may offend some readers)\nBy Scott Malone\nBOSTON (Reuters) - For six weeks, James “Whitey” Bulger’s trial has been like a movie. The famous Boston mob boss has cursed in court, his own lawyer called him a mobster, and a possible witness was found dead on the road.\n\nAs prosecutors get ready to end their case soon and let the defense speak, people wonder if the 83-year-old will make it more dramatic by talking in court. \nBulger’s life story inspired the 2006 film “The Departed.” In the 1970s and 80s, he was one of Boston’s most feared criminals. \nHe led a gang that prosecutors say sold drugs, tricked bookies, and killed rivals, suspected informants, and innocent people.\n\n“There is a good chance that Whitey will testify for one last chance to settle scores and embarrass old rivals,” said Mark Pearlstein, a former federal prosecutor. \nBulger lost his light-colored hair that gave him the nickname “Whitey.” He says he is not guilty of all charges, but he was famous as the head of the Winter Hill gang in South Boston for many years.\n\nThe trial showed the years of violence, as witnesses told how the gang sold drugs and guns, tricked bookies and business owners, and killed rivals and innocent people.\nOn Thursday, police said one of Bulger’s victims, who wanted to testify, was found dead. The body showed no signs of harm, but they are doing an autopsy and toxicology tests.\n\nLawyers often tell their clients not to speak in court. They say it can make the jury dislike the accused more than it helps to tell their side. \nHowever, after hearing from many witnesses like former mob partners and victim families for six weeks, Bulger might think he has nothing to lose.\n\nBulger might also want to deny the accusation that makes him mad: being an FBI informant. \nIn his opening statements, lead defense lawyer J.W. Carney said Bulger was an extortionist, drug dealer, and loan shark who ran a very profitable crime operation.\n\nThe defense did not admit, and tried to deny, that Bulger worked with the FBI and a corrupt agent named John Connolly. The agent is serving 40 years for murder and racketeering. \nBulger says he paid Connolly for information but didn’t give any himself. He thinks talking to the FBI, or “being a rat,” is the worst thing for a gang member. Prosecutors say Bulger killed people he thought talked to the FBI.\n\nBulger had one of his big outbursts in court when Connolly’s boss, John Morris, talked about his connection with the FBI. \n“You’re a fucking liar,” Bulger shouted.\n\nPeople watching the trial say outbursts like this show Bulger thinks he can’t win against charges that could send him to jail for life. \n“I will be very surprised if ‘Whitey’ Bulger testifies,” said Thomas Peisch, a Boston lawyer. “But, it seems he has nothing to lose, and his ego might make him do it.”\n\nBulger ran away from Boston for 16 years after Connolly warned him about his arrest in 1994. He was on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted” list, and many in Boston thought he would never be found. \nAgents caught him in June 2011, living in an apartment in Santa Monica, California.\n\nNow that he is back in the news, Bulger might want one last chance to add to the story of a mobster who lived by a rough code of justice and silence. \n“If he testifies, it’s because he knows it's over. He might have a hard time, but he wants to fight back and shout at the prosecutors,” said Richard Lehr, a professor and author of a book on Bulger.",

    "GPT_Result": "In Fracture, Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) is a confident but nice prosecutor who is rising in his career. He is about to leave his job as an assistant D.A. to join a big, fancy law firm. His new beautiful boss, Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike), wants to help him succeed in different ways. What could go wrong?\n\nBefore he moves, he agrees to take one last case for the D.A.'s office. Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) catches his wife cheating and shoots her, then signs a confession. It seems like an easy case, but the smart prosecutor with a 97 percent success rate quickly gets caught in Crawford's trap.\n\nA surprise in court makes Crawford's confession useless, and Beachum finds out they can't find the gun used in the crime. Crawford tells Beachum, \"If you look closely, everything has a weak spot.\" Sadly, Fracture has too many weak spots.\n\nEven with great actors, Fracture has problems: It is slow, lacks a fresh story, and its main characters remind us too much of The Silence of the Lambs. Also, exciting parts, like when Beachum rushes to the hospital, are too slow, so you lose interest.\n\nThe romance between Beachum and his new boss comes from nowhere, and it doesn't make sense that Nikki would risk her job just to be with a new employee. The movie also fails in funny moments because it doesn't prepare the right mood for them.\n\nThe biggest letdown in Fracture is the missed chance for a good connection between Gosling and Hopkins. Gosling can act cocky yet make you like him; his face is very expressive and draws you in. He makes his boss's interest seem almost believable.\n\nGosling needs a better co-star than Hopkins, who seems to act the same as in The Silence of the Lambs. Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter style is getting old. His odd behaviors, like flaring nostrils and slowly closing his eyes, are not close to self-mockery; they fully are.\n\nAlthough Fracture had potential, it feels too familiar and not exciting.

    "GPT_Result": "The Montreal area has approved a new building for adults with mental illness in Pierrefonds.  \nCentre Bienvenue, a non-profit started 33 years ago to help adults with mental illness, has operated a day center at Gouin Blvd. and Perron St. for about ten years.  \nThe organization plans to tear down the old one-storey building from the 1960s and build a new three-storey building that will have subsidized housing for some of its 210 clients.  \nThe city council used a law that allows social housing for people needing help, using the Act respecting the Société d’habitation du Québec, to approve the Centre Bienvenue project last month.  \n“No matter what our zoning rule is in that area, the city will allow building a place like this to help people in need,” said Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough spokesperson Johanne Palladini.  \n“To do this, the council must pass a resolution to confirm the project follows the charter.”  \nWhile the city law is above any local zoning, the borough had already approved the project earlier this year.  \nBy using this law with provincial social housing rules, the city prevented any not-in-my-backyard protests, said Centre Bienvenue director Benoit Vallée, adding they will talk to nearby residents about their project.  \n“We’ve been here for 10 years with no problems with our neighbors,” he said.  \nThe Centre Bienvenue site is next to the Monsieur Patate Frites restaurant.  \nThe Pierrefonds Medical Centre is across the street on the west side of the intersection.  \nThe new building will have 21 apartments plus office space and rooms to run support activities on the ground floor.  \nVallée said the new facility will fit in with the neighborhood.  \nThere will be supervision of the residential units all week and at least 16 hours a day, he added.  \n“It will look like an apartment building. It won’t look like an institution,” he said.  \nHe expects the old building to be torn down in July and the new center and apartments to open by December.",

    "GPT_Result": "The U.N. General Assembly asked countries on Wednesday to think about temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling, which disappointed scientists and some countries wanting to stop the harmful fishing now.  \nEnvironmental groups say bottom trawling is killing unknown coral ecosystems and the creatures living there, and it needs to stop so the faraway areas can be studied.  \n“I’m disappointed to be honest, because bottom trawling is the world’s most destructive fishing method, and we have proven this,” said Elliott Norse, president of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute.  \nBottom trawlers use giant nets with wheels, chains, and metal doors to drag across the sea floor and catch fish. These tools destroy everything in their way, breaking corals and making big clouds of sediment that choke any life that escapes.  \nTheir main targets are busy deep-sea mountains called seamounts, home to thousands of coral and fish species, some never identified. Many seamounts are about a mile deep on the edge of the continental shelf, outside national waters, and mostly not regulated by countries.  \nLike all General Assembly resolutions, the moratorium would not be legally binding but would carry international opinion with it.  \nIn February, 1,136 biologists, including Norse, signed a statement asking the United Nations and national governments to ban the practice.  \nJapan and Iceland were among the leading opponents of a ban. They are two of the 11 countries whose fisheries made up 95 percent of the high seas bottom trawling catch in 2001, said the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.  \nThe General Assembly passed two resolutions that avoided a moratorium. The first showed concern about damage to marine environments and asked countries to stop harmful fishing practices. That passed 141-1 with two abstentions. Turkey voted against.  \nThe other resolution asks countries to think about a temporary ban on bottom trawling. The resolution was agreed to verbally.  \nEnvironmental groups say an area twice the size of Europe has already been destroyed by high seas bottom trawling.  \n“They can have as many meetings as they want in 2006 to talk about biodiversity and areas outside national control, but there won’t be much left to actually protect when they finish talking,” said Karen Sack, oceans policy adviser at Greenpeace International.",

    "GPT_Result": "Batman might be the most popular superhero in the world, but his time in Hollywood has not always been easy. The first time Batman appeared in movies was in the 1940s, as serials. His first full-length movie was in 1966, called Batman: The Movie, which was an extension of the funny TV series with Adam West and Burt Ward. Then, in 1989, Tim Burton made Batman a big success by creating a special Gotham City with a dark style, where Batman even killed The Joker.\nBatman Returns in 1992 was mostly successful too, and is still well remembered. Unfortunately, Joel Schumacher then took over as the director. While Batman Forever in 1995 had its fans, Batman & Robin in 1997 was made fun of for being silly like the old TV shows, making the villain Mr. Freeze a joke.\nLuckily for Batman fans, Christopher Nolan fixed the series in 2005 with Batman Begins, which told the story of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. Batman Begins showed how Bruce transformed into a hero and was trained by Ra’s al Ghul's League of Shadows. Now, years after Nolan's other movies The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, Screen Junkies made an Honest Trailer for Batman Begins. You can watch it above.\nLike in the Honest Trailer for The Dark Knight, the deep-voiced narrator agrees that Batman Begins is a very good film. Still, Batman Begins gets some funny comments from Honest Trailers, showing Batman's crimes in the name of justice like attempted murder and arson. The narrator also jokes that it’s still murder if a train does it.\nThe biggest joke from the narrator is about the League of Shadows’ silly plan to destroy Gotham’s water and cause chaos with fear toxin, which is as silly as any plan from the Joker in the ’60s. But at least Ra’s doesn’t make jokes about how the ice age killed the dinosaurs.",

    "GPT_Result": "Yesterday, CBS News published papers showing the State Department stopped or blocked Inspector General investigations into serious wrongdoing by high-ranking officials. This included one Ambassador who left his security team to seek prostitutes in public parks. Today, NBC’s follow-up shows investigators thought the same Ambassador was targeting minor children. Meanwhile, the State Department calls the claims of obstruction and interference “ridiculous.”\n\nThe alleged bad behavior happened when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, according to the documents, which also say these actions may not have been properly investigated. Top state department officials told investigators to “stop the investigation” into the ambassador’s actions, according to the memo. A State Department spokesperson did not confirm the specific investigations, but told NBC News “the idea that we would not vigorously pursue criminal misconduct in a case, in any case, is ridiculous.” Former investigator Aurelia Fedenisn said that investigators did not do well in the case, and that a report published in March was “weakened,” according to her lawyer. “She felt it was important that Congress get this information,” Fedenisn’s lawyer Cary Schulman told NBC News.\n\nAnd this looks worse than it did yesterday:\n\nThe ambassador under investigation “often left his security team to ask for sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children,” according to documents NBC News got.\n\nThis ambassador was called back to Washington for a meeting with Patrick Kennedy, Hillary Clinton’s top assistant at Foggy Bottom. Instead of being removed and investigated, CBS reported yesterday that he was “allowed to return to his job.” Did Kennedy decide that? Or did Hillary Clinton?\n\nChuck Todd reports that Rep. Ed Royce, chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee, plans to start an investigation into this scandal. That will likely include orders for Kennedy and Clinton to provide information, and we might hear Clinton’s famous response to Senator Ron Johnson used in her defense again. It will take a lot of explaining to convince anyone why the US sent a man to represent our nation who was suspected of sneaking out to target minor children for sexual exploitation — and why these investigations were blocked so much that the Inspector General had to alert Congress.\n\nUpdate: The New York Post names names:\n\nA State Department whistleblower has accused high-ranking staff of a big coverup — including hiding findings that members of then-Secretary Hillary Clinton’s security detail and the Belgian ambassador sought prostitutes. A chief investigator for the agency’s inspector general wrote a memo about eight cases that senior officials stopped, including interference by Clinton’s chief of staff, Cheryl Mills.\n\nAnd the ambassador? The Post identifies him as a major Obama supporter:\n\nA Diplomatic Security agent was stopped from investigating US Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman over claims that he sought prostitutes, including minors. “The agent started his investigation and found that the ambassador often left his security team to ask for sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children,” says the memo. “The ambassador’s security team and the embassy’s surveillance team were well aware of the behavior.”\n\nGutman was a major supporter for Obama’s 2008 campaign, raising over $500,000 and writing checks for the inaugural. That might not be very unusual for ambassadors in any administration, but the strange decision to keep Gutman in place suggests a possible connection between his donations and the State Department’s decision to end the investigation.",

    "GPT_Result": "Determina, a company making security products, released an unofficial fix for Microsoft's Web browser on Monday. This happened soon after eEye Digital Security released its own temporary fix.\n\nBoth fixes aim to protect Windows computers from cyberattacks using a new Internet Explorer vulnerability. Microsoft has not created an official update for it yet. Microsoft does not support these fixes and usually advises against using unofficial patches.\n\nThis is the second time this year someone else has released a fix before Microsoft. Last time, experts supported a European researcher's patch. This time, they do not recommend using the unofficial fixes.\n\nExperts advise following Microsoft's advice to turn off the Active Scripting feature in Internet Explorer or using a different browser. Johannes Ullrich, from the SANS Institute, said people should not use these temporary patches. Only those who need Active Scripting in IE should consider an unofficial fix.\n\nThe problem is with how Internet Explorer uses the \"createTextRange()\" tag in Web pages. Since it was known last week, over 200 websites have used it to install harmful software on computers, says security company Websense.\n\nAndreas Marx from the University of Magdeburg in Germany says the Internet Explorer issue is serious but advises against third-party fixes. He says, \"If you are not using IE, you are safe. If you use it, turn off Active Scripting.\"\n\nActive Scripting, or ActiveX Scripting, is used for advanced Web sites with applications. Turning it off in IE might affect how some websites work in the browser.\n\nSusan Bradley, a network administrator in Fresno, Calif., will not be using any unofficial patch. She says that using third-party patches can cause support issues.\n\nThe eEye and Determina fixes stop the vulnerable part of IE 5 and 6, the most used versions, to protect against harmful websites. Both Determina in Redwood City, Calif., and eEye in Aliso Viejo, Calif., make intrusion-prevention products.\n\nMicrosoft says it is working on an official browser fix. The update is planned for April 11, Microsoft's regular patch day. But the company might release it earlier.",

    "GPT_Result": "This year's third annual craft cider week in Ontario will include the grand opening of a bar that celebrates cider by offering more than 80 different types. \nThis tribute to the fermented fruit drink, already popular in Britain, shows cider is becoming popular in Canada. \nCider became popular with Canadian drinkers several years ago, and more people liking cider has pushed craft brewers and big beer companies to compete for money. \"Like how craft beer has made its own space, I think craft cider has just as much or more potential,\" said Joshua Mott, the son of craft cider brewers who will open Her Father's Cider Bar + Kitchen in Toronto in late May. \nThomas Wilson, who grew up on his family's apple orchard and started Spirit Tree Estate Cidery in Caledon, Ont., in 2009, said he and his wife wanted to keep growing apples and used cider to add value and let the business run all year. \nBefore they started, he studied the chances for selling cider in Canada. \n\"We saw the start of cider growing,\" said Mr. Wilson, chairman of the Ontario Craft Cider Association, a new group that now has 20 members as more people enter the business. \n\"The market is very popular right now,\" Mr. Wilson said. \"It's open to anyone who gets there first.\" \nThe Ontario Craft Cider Association says any local, independent cider producer that makes up to 2.5 million litres yearly for local people is called craft. \nAs more cider makers appear, so do the different kinds they create. The taste goes from dry to sweet, and ciders usually have between 4 per cent and 8 per cent alcohol content. \nThis year's Great Lakes International Craft and Perry Competition in Grand Rapids, Mich., judged nearly 800 entries in its commercial division – more than twice as many as the 300 competitors in 2013. \nSales started to grow in 2013, says Euromonitor International's report on cider trends in Canada. \nOverall cider sales jumped 20 per cent to $61-million at Liquor Control Board of Ontario stores in 2014 and '15, with craft cider sales up 93 per cent. \nMike Lachelt, co-owner of Salt Spring Wild Cider on British Columbia's Salt Spring Island, said people buy craft ciders because they like local products and might trust these companies more than bigger ones. \nBut it's not just small, craft cider makers in the competition; big beer companies are also starting cider brands as they try to make up for low beer sales, says Euromonitor. \nMolson Coors Canada, for example, sells three ciders in Canada – Strongbow apple cider, Molson Canadian cider, and the new Wanderoot craft cider. They are only sold in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. \nWanderoot is Molson's answer to the growing taste for craft cider and is aimed at older drinkers who love craft products, said Kristi Knowles, vice-president of insights, innovation, and portfolio strategy. \nThe company has been looking at cider's potential for a while. Four years ago, it decided to try to lead the national market, and according to its data, its ciders now take up about 23 per cent of market share, she said. \nMolson Coors Canada wants to reach more than 40 per cent over the next six years. Ms. Knowles said part of that plan involves getting more of its cider on draft in restaurants and bars, trying new flavours, and selling variety packs. \n\"We are looking at what gaps we have in our range and how we might fill them,\" said Ms. Knowles, suggesting the company might create more new products or buy an existing one. But Ms. Knowles said the company believes its three current offerings cover a wide range of consumer tastes and will keep investing in them heavily.",

    "GPT_Result": "The lovely Duchess of Cambridge and her royal husband, the Duke of Cambridge, known to many as Kate and Wills, have been seen in public a lot since their big royal wedding at Westminster Abbey on April 29.\nFirst, they met U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, which started many discussions about who dressed better. (Most people thought Kate looked the best, but we think Michelle was very classy too.)\nThey were photographed again this week at a charity ball, all dressed up and looking very royal.\nTo say the new royal couple has brought back love for the monarchy not seen since William's mother Diana would be an understatement. They are young, smart, and seem to be in love. With a palace, nice clothes, a prince in uniform, and a carriage, it is like a fairytale.\nBut something is happening with the Duchess. It seems she is not eating enough.\nShe may be naturally thin — her mom and sister are also slim — and she tried to get thinner before the wedding, but new photos after the honeymoon show she looks even thinner now. Photos from a recent London gala for a children's charity show Kate looking very thin.\nShe looks so thin that it is starting to look unhealthy and like she is starving.\nDoes it matter if the Duchess is this thin? It shouldn't, but society tells women — especially famous women like politicians, stars, or royalty — that they must be thin. \"Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels,\" said model Kate Moss. \"I've never eaten a cookie,\" said Spice Girl Victoria Beckham.\nIt's this pressure to be size 0 that makes actress Angelina Jolie look very thin, with legs like sticks. It's why singer Madonna's arms look only like muscle, and why reality stars like the Kardashians always talk about diets. This is why tabloids publish pictures of good and bad beach bodies, which sell millions of copies.\nSomehow it is not who someone is that matters, but how many calories they eat.\nBut again, does it matter? Is it anyone's business? It wouldn't be, but there is a lot of talk about thin Middleton and her thin sister Pippa, who recently almost won a \"Rear of the Year\" contest in Britain, that you wonder if this is all they think about.\nIt matters because young people, especially girls, look up to princesses and pop singers. It matters because many young girls today have issues with eating, often having bulimia and anorexia. They eat very little, living on coffee and cigarettes.\nIt matters because the world is watching the new duchess. Whether she knows it or not, she is now one of the most-followed celebrities.\nIt matters because she's a princess, making her a role model for anyone who wants to be a princess.\nClick here for more photos of the royal couple at Thursday’s gala.",

    "GPT_Result": "Early morning joggers run past each other on the Sydney Harbour waterfront near the city center on February 7, 2007. New research says moderate exercise like walking can be as good or better than intense workouts for some heart health parts. NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Moderate exercise like walking might be as good or better than hard workouts for certain heart health parts, new research shows. In a study of 240 overweight, middle-aged adults, researchers found that moderate exercise, but not hard activity, made blood fats called triglycerides better in the participants. Also, improvements in \"good\" HDL cholesterol depended on how much people in the study exercised, not how hard. Researchers also found that these benefits stayed even when people stopped exercising for a while. This is good news for people who sit a lot and find it hard to start running every day, say the study authors. However, there is bad news for people who sit a lot and want to stay that way. In the study, people who stayed inactive saw their \"bad\" LDL cholesterol levels go up after just six months. The bad effects don't end there. Past work with the same study group showed that people who did not move continued to gain weight and inches around the waist, the head study author Dr. Cris A. Slentz told Reuters Health. \"In overweight or mildly obese people who do not move, staying inactive is worse than we thought,\" said Slentz, an exercise expert at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. He and his team share the findings in the Journal of Applied Physiology. The study involved 240 overweight, inactive men and women who were randomly put into four groups. In two groups, people did tough workouts on treadmills or gym machines, but the time spent was different; one group did 20 miles of jogging each week, while the other did 12 miles. A third group did moderate exercise for a medium amount of time -- like walking 12 miles each week. The fourth group did not move. The researchers then checked how each exercise plan changed participants' cholesterol and triglyceride levels over six months and if the improvements stayed after exercisers took two weeks off. On average, they found that only people who did moderate exercise had lasting improvements in their triglycerides. Long-lasting improvements in HDL levels were seen only in people who exercised hard for a longer time. The same HDL benefit was not seen in people who did tough exercise for a shorter time each week. So, Slentz said he and his team believe the benefit is because of the amount of exercise, not the effort level. Slentz says the key point is that \"almost all benefits\" of exercise are connected to the amount, not the effort level. An exception is that tough exercise, like jogging, is better at improving heart fitness -- which, Slentz noted, might or might not matter for heart disease risk. So a person's choice of exercise should depend on their goals, according to the researchers. For many people, that will mean moderate activity. The \"great thing\" about such exercise, Slentz said, is people only need two 15-minute times each day to take a walk. SOURCE: Journal of Applied Physiology, August 2007.",

Simons replaced John Galliano after he left in 2011 because of a scandal.\nDIOR’S PARIS STYLE\nUS Vogue fashion leader Anna Wintour, former French First Lady Bernadette Chirac, and Chinese actress Liu Yifei were at the smaller front row of the show inside the beautiful Rodin Museum gardens.\nIn the clothes, the “casual, relaxed Paris woman today” mixed with famous styles from the 1940s and 1950s.\nSpecial post-War shoes with sometimes retro ankle bows were worn with embroidered silk gowns in free shapes — often with “bare” highlighted shoulders. \nA few flapper-style lace, chiffon, and tulle outfits brought back the happy feeling of the 1920s — between the two World Wars.\nThe studio team also tried new ideas with the famous “bar jacket” — it “changes look depending on if it’s closed or loose,” said the notes.\nIt came in many styles: tight, embroidered black wool, loose and white, open to show the chest elegantly, oversized and manly, or as a beautiful dark navy wool coat.\nThere were also hints of past creative directors' ideas — like Galliano and Simons — nicely shown in an off-white wool jacket with wide 18th-century cuffs.\nSCHIAPARELLI’S FOOD-THEMED FASHION\nActress Bosworth — with an elegant hairstyle — came to the Schiaparelli front row on Monday, sitting next to pop singer, model, and former French First Lady Carla Bruni — who distracted some by talking on her cellphone.\nDesigner Bertrand Guyon continued to explore the exciting world of designer Elsa Schiaparelli in his second show for the house.\nThe Monday morning show featured fashion inspired by food.\nIt was an interesting way to show the fun “Schiap,” as she was known, who loved good food.\nPlates lined the walls of the show place, and clothes inspired by the table — like plant drawings and vegetable prints — opened the show with light, sporty skirt suits.\nSometimes it worked well — but other times the ideas were too clear, like one cream floor length dress that looked like a red striped tablecloth with plates on it.\nThe collection got better as it went into the evening.\nBy then, fashion fans could almost hear their stomachs growling.\nRALPH & RUSSO’S STAR ATTRACTION\nShowing they are strong players in the couture world, newer designers Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo are bringing big names to their shows. \nPulp Fiction star Thurman was photographed a lot as she arrived in a little black dress and silk shawl at the Monday afternoon show.\nThe youthful-looking 45-year-old is in Paris for a private dinner hosted by the couture house and French jewelry brand Chopard.\nThe house said the event will be “celebrating the best work” of couture — and will have a music performance by Ora.\nVALLI GOES 60S AND EMPIRE STYLE\nA strong 60s style was part of Giambattista Valli’s vision for spring — always shown in a long line of cocktail dresses and long gowns.\nA silk jacquard cocktail dress in two-tone grey had a tight retro top and an A-line mini dress.\nAnother silk crepe dress with delicate embroidered flowers had big organza ruffles on the sleeves that looked like a bolero jacket, also popular in that time.\nAs the show went on, the dresses became more structured — using the Empire Line style, like one dress with printed lilies and a tight, embroidered top.\nThe long, flowing silk mousseline dresses at the end of the collection also showed the gentle romantic style of the early 19th century.",

It has already tried this technology in New Zealand, California, and Brazil.\n“Google asked the government to set up the Loon project and internet transmission by drones. The government has approved testing only for the Loon project for now. A committee led by the Secretary of DeitY has been made to work on it,\" an official source told PTI.\nGoogle might first work with BSNL to test this technology using the 2.6GHz broadband spectrum.\nWhen asked, a Google spokesperson did not want to comment.\nAccording to Google, each balloon can connect to a ground area about 40 km wide using a wireless communications technology called LTE or 4G.\nTo use LTE, Project Loon teams up with telecom companies to share cellular spectrum, so people can access the Internet directly from phones and other LTE devices. Google uses solar panels and wind to power the electronics in the balloon all day.\nThe source said that Google might work as a technology service provider, not an internet service provider.\n“The DeitY committee is looking at different things to help testing, like finding locations and working with other agencies. In the drone project, Google planned to send internet to the ground using 8 big solar-powered drones, but the government has not approved that yet,” sources added.\nFirst Published: Nov 03, 2015 10:59 IST",

    "GPT_Result": "A long-awaited report from the State Department found that the Keystone XL pipeline is unlikely to greatly affect the development of the western Canada tar sands. This conclusion disagrees with opponents who said the project would increase greenhouse gas emissions a lot. The department released a new environmental report to look at a new route for the pipeline that would avoid a sensitive area in Nebraska. While the report did not give a recommendation on what to do next, it did not find major environmental problems for the project. The project aims to move crude oil from western Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. The department is studying the proposal to give advice to President Barack Obama, who will decide if the project can go ahead. The finding that the project would not greatly increase emissions that cause global warming is a big setback for environmentalists. They had wanted a full review of greenhouse gas impacts from getting and burning the fuel.\n\n\"With this early review, we find that approving or denying any one oil transport project, like this one, likely won't change how fast the oil sands are developed or how much heavy oil is needed in the U.S.,\" said Kerri-Ann Jones, an assistant secretary at the State Department. Environmentalists were very upset by this finding, which Michael Brune of the Sierra Club called \"very wrong.\" \"We don't understand how the State Department can see the bad effects of using this dirty oil on the climate but then say the pipeline will not cause major environmental harm,\" said Brune. He was surprised because the report came from an agency led by Secretary of State John Kerry, who had supported efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Senate. Bill McKibben, who started the climate change group 350.org, said the report was like the State Department not seeing the Arab Spring coming. He said it was \"really sad\" that the worries of opponents and scientists were ignored with \"old, repeated ideas.\"\n\nSenator Barbara Boxer said she would carefully look at the impact statement. \"I am still very worried about the dangerous climate change that the Keystone XL pipeline could cause,\" said Boxer. But people who support the project used the findings to push for faster approval of the pipeline. \"It's time to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which has had over four years of detailed environmental reviews,\" said Senator John Cornyn from Texas. He added that approving Keystone and the jobs it brings is important for energy plans. Industry groups were also happy with the early review. Chip Yost of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the study is a \"step in the right direction\" for the project's final approval. \"Americans are tired of Washington's delays, and Keystone XL shows the problem with too much government process,\" he said. \"It's time for the administration to quickly finish its review and approve the pipeline to create jobs.\"\n\nPresident Obama had turned down a previous application by TransCanada because of concerns about the original route through Nebraska's sensitive Sand Hills region. But he asked TransCanada to submit a new plan with a different route, and they did so last May. Environmentalists say getting and using the heavy tar sands oil uses a lot more energy than regular oil, which would greatly increase carbon pollution. A report last May from the Congressional Research Service said building the pipeline could increase greenhouse gas emissions as much as adding 588,000 to 4 million more cars. But the State Department review found that saying no to the pipeline would not really affect how fast the oil sands are developed or the heavy crude oil demand in the U.S. If the pipeline was denied and other projects moved forward, stopping Keystone would make little difference in emissions.\n\nBig changes in the world oil market would be needed to greatly slow down oil sands production. Publishing the draft review in the Federal Register will start a 45-day comment period and include a public meeting in Nebraska, says the State Department. After the study is finalized, the department will lead a government effort to decide if the project is good for the nation. The final decision is up to the president. The State Department says it will not make a final decision on the pipeline until the second quarter of the year. Earlier, it said it expected a decision in the first quarter of 2013.",

SSFS CEO Diane Manns told the agents they can help fight domestic violence by giving monthly donations to SSFS.  \nSutherland Shire mayor Carmelo Pesce spoke to the audience at the start of the Unlock program.  \nLeading real estate agency bosses learned about the Unlock Program, a new plan by SSFS to raise money for families and children affected by domestic violence.  \nReal estate agents sell homes as happy places.  \nBut for some, home is not safe or happy.  \nLocal agents learned this message at the launch of a program to help victims of domestic violence.  \nDemand for domestic violence services has gone up in 12 months, with SSFS getting more referrals.  \nSSFS now works with more than 175 families at once, with many more waiting for help.  \nBecause of higher demand, SSFS is asking for more community support.  \nIn a new program, SSFS and local real estate agents promised money support for domestic violence programs for the next year.  \nYesterday, real estate bosses were introduced to the Unlock Program to raise money for affected families at a breakfast at Cronulla RSL.  \nIn this program, real estate agents will make monthly donations to support SSFS's domestic violence programs.  \nThey can give at gold, silver, or bronze levels: $500, $200, or $100 monthly.  \nSSFS supporters like Ben Fairfax and Chris Ryan, Mayor Pesce, and others led talks about the future of the property market in the shire.  \nThe panel talked about how businesses in the property industry should know that building communities is more than just building homes.  \nSSFS CEO Diane Manns told agents their monthly donations can help fight domestic violence.  \n\"We made the Unlock Program to raise awareness of domestic violence and gather needed funds for our service so we can keep helping,\" Ms. Manns said.  \n\"Many women and children live in fear and need support like individual help, crisis safety planning, and programs to heal them,\" she added.  \nDavid Highland, who joined the program, said police attend to 12 families for domestic violence daily, with children present in three out of five homes. He said it's hard to not help.  \nSuzanne Hibberd from Abode Property Agents was eager to support the program.  \n\"This program lets us really help people in our community,\" she said.  \n\"Being a local agent for over 20 years, I’m glad to be in an industry that supports the community like this.\"  \nSeveral other agents joined the program and will support SSFS in helping children and families impacted by domestic violence.  \nSSFS is a local, not-for-profit organization that supports families, especially those hit by disadvantage, violence, and trauma.  \nSSFS is based in Jannali, with extra programs in Engadine, and has supported families in the Sutherland Shire for 30 years.  \nTo donate to SSFS, visit their website at www.ssfs.org.au/donate.",

    "GPT_Result": "Diet trends often change. One new trend people try is a gluten-free diet to lose weight. Cleveland Clinic Dietitian Kristin Kirkpatrick says gluten-free diets have a place, but losing weight is not usually why.\n\n\"Usually, people who can't have gluten have something called celiac disease. Now, we also see people who are truly sensitive to gluten and can't eat it, but because it is popular, many try gluten-free diets for weight loss,\" explained Kirkpatrick.\n\nGluten is a protein in wheat, barley, and rye. It makes dough stretchy and baked goods chewy. People with celiac disease have stomach pains, bloating, and diarrhea when they eat gluten.\n\nIt is an immune response, and the only way to handle it is to avoid gluten completely. But there is no proof that a gluten-free diet will help you lose weight. Kirkpatrick suggests if you can eat gluten, you should focus on a healthy diet overall.\n\n\"We must remember that eating more calories than you burn will make you gain weight,\" she said.\n\nYou can make a healthy diet by cutting out many low-nutrient, high-calorie foods that a gluten-free diet avoids. These include bread, pizza, cookies, and crackers.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

    "GPT_Result": "Senator Roméo Dallaire, a famous Canadian soldier, is starting a mental health and addiction group in Alberta. Queen’s University is also starting a mental health group after some suicides, but both are watching the problems of the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC), a big federal project.\n\nThe MHCC got in trouble after a draft of its mental health strategy was leaked. People accused them of not working well and ignoring severe mental illnesses.\n\nCritics noticed the 30-page draft said \"recovery\" 67 times and \"support\" 125 times, but did not mention \"psychiatry,\" \"schizophrenia,\" or \"bipolar.\"\n\nLast month, Louise Bradley, MHCC’s chief, said in a letter to Canadians they would fix the strategy before releasing it next year, because it didn’t include important roles of treatment and psychiatry.\n\nThe MHCC tries to balance two views of mental health: one sees recovery as personal growth, and the other sees it sometimes requires treatment against the person's will.\n\nThe big issue is whether mental illness is a brain problem or a result of society's stigma.\n\nThe MHCC's job is to make a national mental health strategy. This will guide research funding and set province goals.\n\nThey also work to reduce the stigma of mental illness, mainly focusing on healthcare providers.\n\nAs they change the strategy, the MHCC still struggles with balancing ideas, but a spokesman said the draft is “relatively close.”\n\nThe draft focuses on “recovery” and suggests stopping certain practices with patients, like seclusion.\n\nIt focuses on mental wellness, which some say is not the same as dealing with serious mental illness.\n\nHerschel Hardin from the North Shore Schizophrenia Society criticized the MHCC for using positive words to avoid hard truths.\n\nHe believes MHCC wrongly claims recovery cannot be led by others and must be done alone.\n\nHe says that for seriously ill people, recovery often needs outside help and structure.\n\nHe criticizes the MHCC for not focusing on the essential parts and using confusing language.\n\nThe language in the mental health field makes things complicated.\n\nPeople call patients \"survivors\" or \"experts by experience,\" while medical terms try to explain a lack of understanding about one's own illness.\n\nBill Honer, a mental health expert from the University of British Columbia, explained that \"recovery\" in mental health means a way of life, not like recovering from a disease or cold.\n\nProf. Honer warns that letting people find their own recovery path may not be fair to those who don't understand their illness.\n\nEmpowering words and their meanings sometimes cause confusion, he said.\n\nMs. Bradley refused to talk, but Howard Chodos, who made the draft, said it was created after many meetings and a survey.\n\nMost people supported the strategy’s general direction, but it now includes more public feedback due to the leaked draft.\n\nHe admitted they couldn't involve everyone, but they believe they will strengthen the document with feedback.\n\nMr. Chodos admitted the draft's language was not great for connecting with people.\n\nHe denied that focusing on consensus hides the hard issues.\n\nHe believes they can balance the two views without ignoring either one.",

    "GPT_Result": "I think I am the only person who led panels last week at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York City and Opportunity Green, a green business conference in Los Angeles. It might seem unfair to compare a big meeting of important people in politics, charity, finance, and business to a small meeting of design startups and vegan caterers, but there were some clear similarities (like people from NBC and Coca-Cola being there). As at every conference, people were more interested in talking, getting free items, connecting to Wi-Fi, and finding a power outlet than they were in the sessions. More seriously, the ideas on stage about how to improve the world and make big business more green felt old.\n\nThank goodness for Jeff Swartz. Whether he is onstage or in a private talk, the Timberland CEO speaks honestly. On a CGI panel with Walmart's senior VP of sustainability Matt Kistler, and The Nature Conservancy’s lead scientist, M. Sanjayan, he said, “The private sector is not the answer because there is no answer. Lack of leadership is the problem–the government needs to set rules. I’m getting old and tired of winning battles. I’m afraid of losing the war.”\n\nThat was on Tuesday. On Thursday, I was onstage–at a real studio, the L.A. Center Studios–with Gopal Krishna, marketing VP from Coca-Cola, and three green entrepreneurs who were good examples of winning battles with design. Worthy of special note, Jason Foster made Replenish as a company for eco-friendly cleaning, with special spray bottles where you attach refills to the bottom; the cleaner has great natural properties too. But it is still chemical cleaner in a plastic bottle that may or may not be recyclable in your local area.\n\nGopal Krishnan, a marketing VP from Coca-Cola, showed a short video of their new PlantBottle (first announced last May). \"Up to\" 30% of each bottle is made from sugarcane byproducts. The animated video said that Coca-Cola aims for \"100% recyclable\" bottles, but Krishnan said this actually meant 100% recycled bottles.\n\nBut it is not true that Coca-Cola uses 100% recycled bottles. When I worked on my story for the November issue of this magazine, Conrad MacKerron of As You Sow, a corporate social responsibility group, told me that Coke, Pepsi, and other drink companies spend a lot of time and money fighting deposit and take-back laws. These laws are the best way to ensure containers get recycled. Because of this, recycling rates in the United States have dropped since the 1990s, from over 50% to less than 40%. However, in the 11 states with deposits, the rates are over 80% on average.\n\nWhat Coca-Cola really wants was also shown in the video.",

    "GPT_Result": "At least phone psychics have interesting personalities. The OECD has a new report that criticizes its economists for having unclear predictions in their recent forecasts. The Wall Street Journal reports: \nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Tuesday that it underestimated how much economic and banking problems in one country would affect others. This mistake led it to predict stronger growth than what actually happened after the 2008 financial crisis. But in the latest analysis of forecasting mistakes by an international financial body, the OECD said it didn’t agree with the International Monetary Fund that misjudging the impact of budget cuts on growth was a major mistake.\nThat last part is important because it goes against the progressive viewpoint. Since the recession, liberal economists, especially Paul Krugman, have blamed most of Europe’s problems on underestimating the harm caused by austerity, which means budget cuts. They have simplified complex economic systems to just one idea: more austerity is bad, less austerity is good. This is why many in Washington get very upset over small budget cuts like sequestration. Now, the OECD admits it didn’t underestimate European austerity after the financial crisis but did underestimate other things, like weak trade and weak banks. Also:\nBigger forecast mistakes from 2007-2012 occurred in countries with strict labor and market regulations before the crisis. This might partly be because at the time, they thought tight regulations could help protect against economic shocks, without realizing that such regulations could slow down necessary changes in the recovery phase.\nIn other words, too many rules may have slowed economic growth. Imagine that!\nAt the Washington Post, Robert Samuelson looks at the OECD's findings and says it is time to stop treating economists as people who can predict the future. The problem is, there are many pundits—some who worked at the Post under Ezra Klein—who believe that charts, graphs, and studies can lead to a bright future of government-guided prosperity. Naturally, Dean Baker, a progressive economist, disagrees with Samuelson's conclusion: “Yes, well we have to keep Robert Samuelson away from the really big numbers, he might hurt himself.” And they say economists can’t be funny!\nBaker’s main argument, in a light blog post, is that Samuelson doesn’t talk about the drop in demand after the housing bubble burst. Of course, weak demand played a part. But the OECD report says that about Europe, economists were wrong because they focused too much on a simple demand-side idea (“Austerity!”) and ignored other factors.\nThis mistake was probably unavoidable. Economies are too complex for simple solutions. Helen Rittelmeyer wrote an excellent piece for First Things showing how intellectuals now prefer data over moral arguments. (Her article costs $1.99, but it’s worth it.) With data experts proven wrong again, maybe it’s time to stop believing economists can solve all our problems with charts.",

    "GPT_Result": "In April, a Ugandan man ran away from a quarantine place in Portland, Oregon. People thought he had the Namibian Plague. Law enforcement officers are trying hard to find Asaba, but people in Portland are scared to say they know him. They are afraid they will be taken away from their families to the quarantine place he escaped from. The Council on American Heritage says Asaba is very dangerous and is not welcome in America. But Ken Asaba is not real. He is a made-up character voiced by Harold Perrineau from LOST in an online game called America 2049. Breakthrough, a global human rights group, made this game to teach players about social justice issues like immigration and racial discrimination. It uses a story about a future United States where life is controlled by strict and unfair rules. America 2049's new way of mixing political drama and learning brought in Hollywood actors like Perrineau to help with the game. \"I wanted to help with peace and human rights and liked the idea of an online game,\" says Perrineau about why he joined the project. \"When I worked on LOST, some people showed me games, and I thought it would be good to be part of an exciting game. When Breakthrough told me about America 2049, I found it very interesting.\" America 2049 is a first social justice game that uses Facebook's network to make people talk about human rights. \"Breakthrough wants to use creative ways to tell stories about democracy and diversity,\" says Mallika Dutt, who leads Breakthrough and works for human rights. \"Media and arts are important to get people talking.\" America 2049 puts players in future Portland as an agent trying to find Asaba in a world where some freedoms are lost. Players see different parts of US history with civil rights, like a 1923 immigrant card and a 2010 poster against a travel ban. Dutt and Heidi Boisvert wanted to make players think about today's social unfairness through a deep game. \"Games are a great way to show social and political issues, try new identities, and solve problems together,\" says Boisvert. \"People think of games like GTA as violent, but we can use game ideas to make people think differently. The game is part of a larger project to make people act and learn in real life too.\" \"We need to talk about human rights with more people, not just in closed groups,\" says Dutt. \"Games can bring new and different ideas about America into these talks.\" Facebook, with its many users and games like FarmVille, is a perfect place to reach many players. America 2049 plays mainly on Facebook but is also on other sites like fake news pages. America 2049 has only about 20,000 active users, not as big as FarmVille. The gameplay can be slow, and the political messages are strong, with little player cooperation. Even with some problems, the game's real-world events, like education meetings, show people are interested in the human rights issues. Over 100 people came to an immigration event in San Francisco, and many went to a human trafficking talk in Chicago. \"More people are coming to our real events, and they care about the game's topics,\" says Dutt.",

The well began production in 2010 at a rate of 1,000 MCF per day. On April 15th, the company started increasing the rate to 4,000 MCF per day, aiming to reach 5,000 MCF per day by Mid-October.  \n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20040913/ROYLLOGO  \n(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20040913/ROYLLOGO  \nWith over 100,000 MCF produced so far, the reservoir has not shown much pressure decline, giving confidence to the company's estimates of the overall size of the accumulation.  \nRoyale has now applied for permits to drill up to three more wells into the accumulation, with two of these wells planned for the 4th quarter of 2010.

    "GPT_Result": "Beawiharta, REUTERS | A view of burnt trees in an area for palm oil plantations near Teluk Meranti village in Pelalawan, Indonesia's Riau province on November 11, 2009.  \nFrance made plans on Wednesday to fight deforestation worldwide, saying it would try to reduce imports of products like palm oil, soy, and beef that harm forests.  \nIn a joint statement, five French ministries proposed 17 steps aimed at stopping deforestation from unsustainable forest or farm products by 2030.  \nPalm oil, a type of vegetable oil used in candy and other goods, is controversial because clearing forests for plantations hurts the environment.  \nMost of the world's palm oil comes from Malaysia and Indonesia, where deforestation has threatened orangutan populations.  \nThe ministries said that between 1990 and 2015, the world's forest area shrank by 129 million hectares (319 million acres), which is eight times the size of France's mainland forest.  \n\"This causes an 11 percent rise in greenhouse gas emissions and big impacts on biodiversity and natural habitats,\" the ministries said.  \n\"European countries have a big responsibility, since a third of this deforestation is due to European Union countries consuming farm products,\" they added.  \nCompanies and governments, including the EU, have made many promises to stop deforestation recently, but progress has been slow.  \nEarlier this month, France joined six other EU countries in asking the European Commission to make an action plan by the end of the year to address global deforestation.  \nSeven governments ask for quick EU action on global deforestation. Denmark, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway wrote to the EU Commission demanding an action plan by the end of the year.  \nOn Wednesday, plans were announced, including financial help for developing countries to follow no-deforestation criteria, a \"zero deforestation\" label for consumers by 2020, and urging for a European policy on imports that could harm forests next year.  \nWith a renewable energy bill accepted on Tuesday, the EU said it would stop using biofuels with ingredients that cause deforestation by 2030. France supported this measure on Wednesday.  \nIn May, France allowed limited use of palm oil at Total's planned La Mede biofuel plant, which upset environmentalists and farmers who said palm oil would be imported.  \nFormer environment minister Nicolas Hulot said after his appointment last year that he would limit palm oil in French biofuels to cut deforestation in original countries, causing concern from Indonesia and Malaysia, but he took no strong actions.  \n(FRANCE 24 with REUTERS)",

    "GPT_Result": "Captain Marvel is a great new movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with great acting, fantastic action, and one of the best stories in any MCU movie so far. As expected, it also had two postcredits scenes. The first one will probably make you even more excited about Avengers: Endgame, and the second is a funny ending to the film. Definitely stay for the first scene. The second one is up to you. I think the second one is better than the second postcredits scene in Ant-Man and the Wasp. And now, a big spoiler warning if you want to see the movie (and maybe Avengers: Endgame?) without any hints. Composite by Aaron Robinson Scene 1: Carol Danvers, meet... The scene starts with a close-up of Fury's pager from the end of Avengers: Infinity War. It's still beeping, and Captain Marvel's symbol is on the screen. Suddenly, the pager screen goes black. We then see Steve Rogers and Black Widow looking at some holograms, still learning how many people are dead after Thanos' snap. Rhodey comes in and says the pager is no longer sending a signal. We see Bruce Banner, who says the signal finally stopped. Chuck Zlotnick/Marvel Studios \"I thought we fixed the battery,\" Cap says. Rhodey replies, \"We did, it's plugged in, but it stopped.\" Cap says to restart it and send the signal again. Black Widow says the message was important to Fury, and to tell her when the pager works again. \"I want to know who is on the other end of that thing,\" she says. Black Widow turns to leave, and Captain Marvel is standing right in front of her looking angry. After a pause, she asks, \"Where's Fury?\" The scene ends. What it means It looks like Captain Marvel was on the other end of the pager, as everyone thought at the end of Infinity War. Carol also seems to have survived the snap. In one of the last Captain Marvel scenes, Carol gives Fury a new version of his pager, telling him to use it if he ever needs her to come back. So, is this a real scene from Avengers: Endgame, an edited version, or something filmed just for the Captain Marvel postcredits scene? It's hard to say, but I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't exactly how Carol's arrival on Earth happens in Avengers: Endgame. But it was still amazing. Marvel Scene 2: Cute and a little gross We start the scene with a close shot of Nick Fury's desk from 1995. The nameplate says \"N. Fury.\" His office seems empty. The camera zooms in slowly, and Goose the cat comes into view. Like all cats do, especially mine -- a lot lately, annoyingly -- he starts to cough up a hairball. After a few seconds, he coughs up the Tesseract onto Fury's desk. After a moment, the film ends. What it means In the movie, Goose the cat is actually a Flerken.

    "GPT_Result": "If you haven't been to a Ford dealer recently, you really should try driving the Fusion Sport before you buy your next car.\nThe mid-size sedan market is very competitive in the car industry. These cars make up a large part of every car maker's yearly sales. But there are really two parts to the mid-size sedan market — the low-priced bargain models, and the more powerful and luxurious models at the top.\nYou can buy a Ford Fusion for as little as $21,245, and you'll get a nice car for that money. But if you are willing and can spend more to get the Ford Fusion Sport at $32,730, you'll find a really special car waiting for you. The 2017 Fusion Sport can compete with more expensive European and Asian brands in performance, build quality, tech, and comfort.\nThe Fusion Sport has a 2.7-liter turbocharged V6 engine with 325 horsepower and 380 pound-feet of torque. Power goes to all four wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Fusion feels strong on the road, with plenty of power when you press the gas pedal.\nInside, the Fusion has a comfortable luxury interior, with a dial-based gear selector on the console, similar to one you find in a Jaguar. You also get heated suede and leather seats and a nice big touch screen infotainment system with optional GPS navigation.\nThe Fusion Sport is very quiet inside, mostly because of Ford's active noise control system. This system uses a microphone inside to listen to road noise — sounds from the engine, tires, wind, and other traffic. Then the car makes \"opposite\" vibrations and plays them through the speakers. The noise and the vibrations cancel each other out, making the car feel very quiet.\nThe Fusion Sport has all the usual safety equipment you expect in a modern sedan, like a rear-view camera, stability control, and full basic safety features. You can also get features like blind-spot monitoring and automatic high beams if you want.\nOne optional feature to mention is active park assist. With this feature, the Fusion Sport can park itself in parallel or perpendicular spaces automatically. You just turn on the feature, then drive forward until the car finds a big enough spot. Press the button, and the car parks itself. It may take some trust to let the Fusion do this, but it works.\nIf you haven't been to a Ford dealer recently, you really should try driving the Fusion Sport before you buy your next car.\n2017 Ford Fusion Sport\nBase price: $21,245\nPrice as tested: $32,730\nType: Mid-size sedan\nEngine: 2.7-liter turbocharged V6 (325 hp, 380 lbs-ft)\nTransmission: 6-speed automatic\nEPA estimated mileage: 17/26\nRoad Noise: Very quiet\nOverall length: 192 inches\nCurb weight: 3,681 pounds\nFinal assembly: Hermosillo, Mexico",

The company shared new status updates on their website about the project.  \nThe new iOS 6 jailbreak software for iPhone 5/4S/4 has 200 new features that many users find exciting. Many users are waiting for the public untethered jailbreak code, especially after some false leads and scams. Recently, many developers shared updates about jailbreaking iOS 6, and now iJailbreakiPhone5s’ team has similar news.  \nThis year, iJailbreakiPhone5s.com and Ironclad Integrity started working with iPhone jailbreak developers, making fast progress. Recent updates on their website talk about new exploits in iOS 6 and iPhone 5 that allow for jailbreak installation. Currently, the team is testing the code before releasing it to the public, expected soon.  \niJailbreakiPhone5s’s developers considered all ways to install the jailbreak code on iPhone 5, trying to bypass Apple’s new security. Before, jailbreaks worked by exploiting the bootrom, but Apple’s security improvements made hackers find different solutions.  \n“Apple’s A5 devices with iOS 6 make it very hard for us to access the bootrom, making most efforts useless,” said a developer from iJailbreakiPhone5s. Limera1n developers also said it’s hard to access the bootrom. “The bootrom is smaller now, and we can’t even get a copy of it,” said Wang last month.  \nThough progress is slow with the iOS 6 iPhone 5 jailbreak, users are still interested in accessing apps not in the App Store and adding custom themes.  \nFor iPhone 5 tutorials, reviews, and Apple news, visit www.iJailbreakiPhone5s.com.  \niPhone 5 owners want the iOS 6 jailbreak but may worry about its quality and function. iJailbreakiPhone5s keeps iPhone owners informed of the best jailbreak methods and explains all the steps.

    "GPT_Result": "Shannon Foynes Port Company has started a 30-year plan to improve port facilities along the Shannon estuary.  \nThe estuary is the deepest waterway in Ireland and one of the deepest in Europe.  \nIts natural deep water is better than other ports in Ireland because it can handle the huge container ships being made with the Panama Canal expansion.  \nThe port company manages €6 billion of international trade yearly, and more than a third of the country's bulk container traffic now goes through the estuary.  \nIt manages 10 million tonnes of cargo and is growing about 8% each year.  \nThe plan shows how Foynes port and Limerick docks will develop in the next 30 years.  \nThe development will let the company use the estuary's deep water for more business.  \nMinister for Transport Leo Varadkar started the plan called Vision 2041.  \nHe said Shannon Foynes is important for southwest Ireland and he liked the company's goal to bring in big international investment.  \nA new deep water berth will be made at Foynes, and over 300 acres of extra land will be used to build new warehouses and facilities.  \nAlso, the Foynes-Limerick railway line could open again to help new trade, and the roads, especially the N69, will need big improvements.  \nFuture business at the estuary is also linked to changes at the Panama Canal, which will be bigger to fit 80,000-tonne container vessels by 2015.  \nThe estuary's natural deep waters will be a strong point in what is called the post-panamax era.  \nSo, Shannon Foynes Port Company will start talks with IDA Ireland to get more foreign investment and jobs for the Shannon estuary area.  \nShannon Foynes Port Company Chairman Michael Collins said that although it is ambitious and hard, the growth in the plan can be reached.  \n\"With our great chance because of our deepwater and the new big ships, we have a special chance here that we need to use. For these reasons, the estuary is very valuable for investment,\" Mr Collins said.",

    "GPT_Result": "Kathleen Brooks\nThe recent changes in the financial markets show how delicate the economic recovery is. One moment, risky assets seem strong, and the next, investors move to safe places. Investors want an asset that is safe but also has some risk-like features.\nPlatinum and palladium might be good choices. They do well when people are looking for both safe and risky options. These metals act like safe places and are bought when people avoid risk. But they are also used in industry, for things like car parts, hard drives, and dental crowns.\nBecause of this, supply can affect platinum and palladium prices. Precious metal reserves have fallen in recent years because costs are high and people worry about profits, especially with palladium.\nA supply shortage is only a problem if there is enough demand to raise prices. There are signs that demand for these metals will grow, especially in emerging markets. More people in Asia want cars; last year, China sold more cars than the US. This might continue as the middle classes in China and India grow, increasing consumption.\nWhy should investors choose palladium and platinum over gold or silver? Julius Baer, a Swiss fund manager, suggests these metals not just because they are safe, but also due to their industrial use, making them more than just \"crisis metals.\"\nInvestors might be careful about buying gold now since its price is over 20% higher than last year. Meanwhile, platinum and palladium have not done as well as gold and silver, with palladium prices being quite steady.\nJulius Baer says having these metals can improve the risk and reward balance in a portfolio. It notes that these metals don't often move in the same way as other assets. However, it advises a long-term view because these metals can change a lot in the short term.\nFor new investors in palladium or platinum, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) can be a good start. An ETF makes buying the metal simple without worrying about purity or storage, as you can trade it like a share. Also, you can buy small amounts of an ETF, which is smart for beginners.\nDeborah Fuhr from BlackRock says investors need to research if they want to invest in an ETF.\nStephan Mueller from Julius Baer advises finding out what an ETF invests in. Sometimes, ETFs don't hold the physical metal but own claims on the metal owned by banks, which has risk. So, an ETF might not fully show the safe nature of platinum and palladium.\nMueller would avoid ETFs involved with metal miners, as there are risks in that sector: \"Geopolitical risks exist in resources areas, plus political risks and the chance of assets being nationalized.\"\nFor retail investors, it may be good to add palladium and platinum to your investments with other traditional assets. But be sure to do your research first.",

    "GPT_Result": "This story is mine as much as it is yours; the story of the chosen ones, shining like gold.  \nWe entered Stanford confused, looking for the truth — what were we born to do? Everyone else seemed to know. We liked technology but were not programmers yet. We had not interned at Intel, designed for Duolingo, or created an Android app. Still, technology was our best choice because it was what we knew best. It was not easy, but we tried to follow the wise words of our Stanford ancestors: \"All it takes is hard work!\"  \nAfter that, we cried many tears. Our personal goals were ruined. Our expectations were broken. We struggled with deadlines that our friends met easily. We thought we did not have the intelligence for college-level computer science. Why was this harder than expected? We unknowingly set ourselves up to fail by comparing ourselves to others. Our learning journey was always full of sad comparisons to the skills and experiences of our classmates and friends.  \nEverything changed after Art. We made some strange choices: changing our major from Computer Science to Symbolic Systems; moving into Kimball Hall, an arts dorm for transfer students; enrolling in Art History 1B with famous lecturer Alexander Nemerov. These choices helped us grow.  \nChanging our major before officially deciding felt simple, but now we took many humanities classes, which seemed to weaken our computer science skills.  \nLiving in Kimball Hall made us meet very different people: bold singers, artists, writers, and actors. Leaders, dreamers, creators. Being with them made us think about their views on life. They created from their hearts. Here, we finally valued introspection, and the uselessness of comparing our talents to others' became clear.  \nWhile living in Kimball, we started Art History with Professor Nemerov. At first look, he seemed like a \"chill dude.\" We heard great things about his lectures, so we expected to be entertained. Instead, we were changed. Art was just a small part of our mind until this moment when his words captured us.  \nNemerov spoke to us from the stage, giving us ideas like puzzle pieces. These pieces taught us not just facts about art but also how great thinkers process thoughts. We learned that great people do not let comparisons stop them from reaching their goals; they believe in their own thoughts and abilities. This gave us self-expression confidence and freed our potential. We realized we could use these puzzle pieces to create our own masterpiece.  \nWe have achieved great things, but our best work is still to come. Before, by just following career paths set by others, we would have waited for our masterpiece to appear. Now, we choose to create it ourselves.  \nI believe, “All it takes is real belief in yourself and hard work.”  \nContact Coco Hergenroeder at codyhergenroeder 'at' stanford.edu.",

The studio shared a temporary release plan for the DCEU at Comic-Con International in San Diego this summer. Now, a new film is added to the list with Warner Bros. choosing directors for a movie about two famous DC Comics villains.\n\nTHR said the studio is talking with directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa to make a movie with The Joker and Harley Quinn. Actors Leto and Robbie will play the villains again. The movie will come after Suicide Squad 2, but since the sequel has no release date or director, it is not clear when this Joker and Harley Quinn movie will come out.\n\nScreen Rant said Warner Bros. was working on a Harley Quinn and Joker movie called Harley Quinn vs The Joker. THR found out it will be a \"criminal love story\" and one source called it \"an insane and twisted love story. When Harry Met Sally on benzedrine.\" THR also reports Warner Bros. is quickly moving forward with both Suicide Squad 2 and this Joker and Harley Quinn movie, so fans may soon see a lot of Leto and Robbie.\n\nBesides Suicide Squad 2, both Robbie and Leto will be in Gotham City Sirens. Ayer will direct Gotham City Sirens, which will include Catwoman and Poison Ivy, two famous Batman villains. Leto was recently confirmed to be involved in a solo Joker origin movie not in the DCEU. Instead, Warner Bros. is making new DC Comics movies separate from the main superhero universe.\n\nWith the news of the Joker and Harley Quinn movie, Warner Bros. seems focused on popular DCEU characters. The Joker and Harley Quinn film will be the fourth film with these villains, and Wonder Woman 2 was also announced at Comic-Con, set for 2019. For fans wanting other DC Comics characters, many standalone films are planned, and the studio's new projects will also include non-DCEU films. For the DCEU's future, fans hope Warner Bros. can clear up confusion with official announcements and release dates.\n\nSource: THR",

    "GPT_Result": "While most of America took a break for the holidays, one unlucky group did not get a day off.\nI am not talking about the hard-working clerks at Big Box stores that never close, but about the brave people at the American Family Association (AFA). They were busy trying to stop elves from being with a known lesbian.\nIn December, One Million Moms, an angry online group started by the AFA, complained about J.C. Penney for a holiday ad with Ellen DeGeneres.\n“JCP has chosen to upset a large number of their customers again,” Moms said in a statement. “Christians must now choose by spending their money wisely.”\nExaggerating is nothing new for the AFA's group. When Penney first hired DeGeneres last February, Moms attacked the store for “supporting the pro-gay movement.” At that time, their angry comment was tiring, but expected.\nThis time, it was just silly. In the holiday ad, DeGeneres talked about gift-shopping with a few of Santa’s elves. Scary, right?\nNormal people can ignore the angry talk of a small group (as DeGeneres herself noted, you must wonder about a group called One Million Moms that has only about 50,000 Facebook followers). But I am still confused by the mean and persistent actions of the American Family Association itself.\nSince it began in 1977 by a Methodist pastor in Mississippi, the AFA has attacked anything with any connection to being gay.\nSome of its many targets include: the Walt Disney Co., for supporting gay employees; the American Girl doll company, for backing a youth group they called “a pro-abortion, pro-lesbian group.”\nAFA also focused on Hallmark, for selling same-sex wedding cards; the Ford Motor Co., for advertising in gay publications; Archie comic books, for having its first openly gay character marry another man; McDonald’s, for joining the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce; and the Campbell Soup Co., for an ad with a lesbian couple and their son.\nThese people must be tired.\nThough the AFA usually attacks big companies that can defend themselves, it went too far in late 2012 by choosing children as their new target.\nIn October, National Bullying Prevention Awareness Month, it attacked Mix it Up at Lunch Day, a program that encourages kids to make new friends at school to stop bullying.\nThe AFA said the program was “promoting the homosexual lifestyle in public schools,” and asked parents to protest or keep their children home that day.\nSupporters of AFA’s actions said that anti-bullying campaigns focus too much on helping gay kids over other bullying victims. But facts show that gay kids are more likely to be bullied and to attempt suicide.\nThe AFA’s protest didn’t work—only about 200 of the 2,500 schools stopped the event—but it showed that the American Family Association is acting like a bully now.\nYou would think the AFA might learn from election polls, which showed that people do not like negative attacks or personal life interference. You would also think the AFA might learn from the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., that children are precious and should not be bullied.\nIt’s time to ask the AFA to stop. Even with its mission to change this country, the nation doesn’t need its help, thank you.\nBruce Kluger writes for Parenting, The Los Angeles Times, USA Today, and National Public Radio.\nRelated Posts",

    "GPT_Result": "Researchers have made a smartphone device that can do blood tests. They say it could \"improve the quality of life\" for people taking medicine to prevent blood clots. \nBlood clots in the arteries and veins can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. People at high risk of blood clots often take anticoagulants - drugs that make the blood thinner and stop clots from forming. \nBut, anticoagulant therapy needs patients to often check their blood flow in the hospital. Also, if someone takes the wrong dose of anticoagulants, it can cause heart problems instead of stopping them. \nBecause of this, researchers from Qloudlab - a small company at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland - made a device that might let patients check themselves. \nHow does the device work? \nThe gadget has a small single-use film that sticks to a smartphone screen. The film is made from a very thin layer of plastic. \nThe creators say the smartphone device could improve the quality of life for patients using anticoagulant therapy. \nWhen blood enters the film, it can find a molecule in blood that starts clotting. \nThe phone can then read the results by checking changes in the electric field on the phone's screen. \nThis is like what happens when your finger touches a smartphone screen. \nThe results are then sent to a special smartphone app, also made by Qloudlab. \nThis information can then be sent to a doctor, who can decide if a patient's treatment needs to change. \nArther Queval, the founder of Qloudlab, says: \n\"Such a test will greatly improve the quality of life for people on this kind of treatment.\" \nQloudlab has recently asked for a patent for the device and has received money from Venture Kick, allowing them to hire a biochemist. \nThe team hopes that by the end of next year, they will show the device is as good as a lab test and can move towards selling it. \nCombining smartphones with self-monitoring is becoming more popular. Medical News Today recently reported on making a smartphone case that can check vital signs like blood pressure, temperature, and blood oxygen. \nLast year, a study from the University of California, Los Angeles, talked about making a portable device that can do kidney tests and send data through a smartphone.",

    "GPT_Result": "NASA's Raven technology module will go to space on SpaceX's next Falcon 9 rocket launch, planned for Saturday (Feb. 18). Once there, it will stay outside the International Space Station to track vehicles docking with the station, gathering data for future autonomous meeting with orbiting spacecraft. This technology could help researchers fix, refuel, and move old satellites.\nSince NASA's pre-Apollo Gemini spacecraft, which met in orbit, many spacecraft have docked in space with a human helping. The Satellite Servicing Projects Division at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center wants to automate this, so spacecraft can meet and dock by themselves — even with satellites not made for it.\n\"Of the 5,000 or so spacecraft launched since the start, most were not designed to be met or docked in orbit,\" Ben Reed, the division's deputy director, said on Feb. 8. \"We are making technologies for those satellites.\"\nLike the three-eyed raven from \"Game of Thrones,\" NASA's Raven module will use three sensors on the approaching spacecraft: visible, infrared, and lidar.\nNASA's Raven module is shown here before its launch to the space station on SpaceX's Dragon cargo spacecraft.\nThis suitcase-sized technology will go up in the unpressurized \"trunk\" of SpaceX's Dragon cargo spacecraft, and five days after Dragon reaches the station, the station's Dextre robotic arm will unload it and put it outside. With data and technology from Raven, researchers hope to build a machine vision system that guides a spacecraft to meet another.\nRaven will send its measurements in real time to a processor, which will turn the module to keep following the incoming vehicle, NASA officials said in a statement. The module will work on the station for two years, improving sensors and machine vision to track incoming craft.\nRaven will track vehicles approaching the International Space Station, as shown in this artist's picture.\nThe tracking technology developed will be useful soon, NASA officials said — for example, in the Restore-L mission to refuel the Landsat 7 satellite, which will launch in 2020.\n\"The first stage of space exploration was mainly satellites doing one thing,\" Reed said at the news conference. \"We are now entering the stage of missions with satellites being upgraded, serviced, refueled, moved, and assembled in orbit.\"\nYou can watch SpaceX's launch live Saturday, courtesy of NASA and SpaceX. On Friday, NASA will show press conferences on the mission, its cargo, and Launch Pad 39A's history.\nEmail Sarah Lewin at slewin@space.com or follow her @SarahExplains.

    "GPT_Result": "No one could blame Western Mustangs head coach Greg Marshall for feeling a bit lonely these days.  \nThe 2018 U Sports coach of the year said the Mustangs headquarters at TD Stadium felt empty in January. This was because offensive coordinator Steve Snyder left for Queen’s Gaels, offensive line coach Jean-Paul Circelli became Windsor Lancers head coach, recruitment coordinator Joe Circelli followed his brother to Windsor, and receivers coach and video coordinator Josh Malekzadeh went to his family’s business in Toronto.  \n\"The first couple of weeks of January, it was like ‘Oh my goodness. There’s no one here,’” Marshall said with a laugh.  \nThe Mustangs, who played in two Vanier Cups, winning in 2017 and losing in 2018, are also losing special teams coordinator and linebackers coach Adrian Kaiser and defensive backs coach PJ Edgeworth.  \nMarshall is interviewing new candidates and is confident he will find the right people, though he is not making any quick decisions.  \n“You have to look at it as an opportunity,” he said. “It’s tough losing those coaches because they are good friends and good people, but it’s also a chance for us to get someone young who wants to work hard and learn what we do here.”  \nMarshall is proud of the coaches who are leaving and said they will be hard to replace.  \n“That’s what we do at university, right?” he said. “For our players, this is where they learn about football and teamwork. Then they move on and become doctors like Nick Vanin, or lawyers, or pro football players. This isn’t a final destination.”  \nMarshall is not looking for coaches with specific skills, but rather the best people for roles in the Mustangs system.  \n“I know coach (Paul) Gleason is here and can do the defence, and I know I can do the offence,” Marshall said. “So, if the right offensive coordinator is available, as with coach (Steve) Snyder two years ago, I would consider it. But I’m not just going to bring anyone in. It has to fit well.”  \nMarshall said losing Malekzadeh had an immediate impact because he was a key part of the program, handling many tasks.  \n“He did everything for us,” Marshall said. “That was a big hit because it just left me doing everything, like when I started coaching 30 years ago.”  \nKaiser and Edgeworth are both teachers, great coaches, and role models for the players and will be missed, Marshall said.  \nEdgeworth, a part-time assistant for 15 years, and Kaiser are leaving to spend more time with their families.  \nWith Circelli at Windsor, Snyder at Queen’s, Chris Bertoia at Waterloo, and former Western quarterback Michael Faulds at Laurier, the Mustangs are impacting Ontario university football.  \nCircelli coached several teams, winning titles, and Snyder was also a coach with other teams.  \nBertoia, a former Mustangs coach, also coached other teams. He also coached at Catholic Central secondary school.  \nLondon’s strong high school and minor football programs are great sources for future Mustangs coaches.  \n“We have some of the best high school football in the country here,” Marshall said. “We have an excellent minor system. We have the Beefeaters and a Junior Mustangs summer program.  \n“Our coaches get great training and experience so when they come here they already coach at a high level.”",

    "GPT_Result": "Peter Dazeley / Photographer's Choice / Getty\nMaybe it is because of TV shows like Nip/Tuck, Dr. 90210, or Extreme Makeover, but Internet data shows that young adults are now very interested in changing how they look. Plastic surgery used to be popular with rich women in their fifties, but now it is more popular with younger people who have less money.\nThe recent sad death of Stephanie Kuleba, an 18-year-old cheerleader who died during breast enlargement surgery, made us notice that teenagers want more \"perfect\" bodies. In fact, data from searches shows this is true. One of the top sites people visit after searching \"plastic surgery\" is the American Society of Plastic Surgeons’ site (www.plasticsurgery.org). Over 25% of visitors to the site are aged 18 to 24—higher than 19.6% two years ago.\nPlastic surgery has become very popular in America. In other places like the U.K. and Australia, young people's interest in plastic surgery is mostly happening in the U.S.\nLooking at other health sites that 18- to 24-year-olds visit shows their strong interest in appearance. Unlike older people who visit health sites about diseases and staying healthy, younger people go to sites about looks, like those about bodybuilding, weight loss, skincare, and plastic surgery.\nWhile TV shows about surgery might make young people interested, one thing seems to stop many teens from changing their looks: the poor U.S. economy.\nIf we look at searches like \"breast augmentation,\" \"breast implants,\" or \"plastic surgery,\" these have dropped a lot in the past year. Why is this happening? It might be because most visitors to cosmetic surgery sites make less than $30,000 per year. In fact, recent search patterns show \"cost\" is the main concern. We see more searches like \"breast implant cost,\" \"plastic surgery cost,\" and \"breast augmentation cost.\" In April 2007, cost was not as important.\nWhile older people still search for information on face-lifts, liposuction, or Botox, younger people focus on improving their looks but at a lower price during tough economic times.\nBill Tancer is the general manager of global research at Hitwise.",

    "GPT_Result": "New data from the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting suggests a benefit to combining L-methylfolate, a prescription medical food called Deplin®, with an antidepressant at the start of treatment. This analysis showed patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) improved more in a shorter time when they used both treatments together. The study compared patients taking L-methylfolate with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) against patients taking only an SSRI or SNRI.\n“We know from studies that nearly 70% of depressed people will not get better with just one antidepressant, so we need a new approach,” explained Dr. Lawrence D. Ginsberg, the study's main researcher, from Red Oak Psychiatry in Houston, Texas. “Adding L-methylfolate to an antidepressant at the start is beneficial for these patients.”\nThe study showed that:\n-- 2.5 times more patients had big improvements in their depressive symptoms, ability to function, and behavior with combination therapy compared to just antidepressant therapy.\n-- Patients on combination therapy got 23% better faster than those on only antidepressant therapy (p=0.03). The faster improvement for the combination group lasted through the study period (about two years).\n-- By 60 days, patients on combination therapy had already shown significant improvement (p=0.011) in their CGI scores compared to those on just antidepressant therapy.\n-- Discontinuation rates due to bad side effects were much lower in the combination group (17.9%) compared to the antidepressant-alone group (34%) (p=0.0078), even though the overall side effect rates in both groups were not very different.\nThe main measure used in the study was a two-point decrease in the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score, a seven-point scale from the National Institute of Mental Health. The CGI-S score is decided by a clinician and considers all information, including the patient's history, life situation, symptoms, behavior, and how symptoms affect the patient's ability to function.\n“We found that starting patients with both L-methylfolate and an antidepressant was a quicker way to help them get better,” explained Dr. Ginsberg. “Even with a tough measure, looking for a real reduction in symptoms, we saw that patients on combination therapy improved a lot in symptom severity and got better faster with ongoing improvement.”\nAbout the Study\nResearchers did a study by looking back at records from 242 adults, ages 18-70, with MDD (single or repeated), and a CGI-S score of four (moderately ill) or five (markedly ill), with some functional problems. Patient records were split into a combination group (SSRI or SNRI with L-methylfolate 7.5-15 mg at treatment start; n=95) or a control group (SSRI or SNRI alone at treatment start; n=147). Data were collected on patient details, including scores before and during treatment using the CGI-S scale.\nAbout Deplin®\nDeplin is a prescription medical food for managing low L-methylfolate levels in people with depression. Up to 70% of people with depression might have a genetic problem that makes it hard to turn folic acid into L-methylfolate. L-methylfolate is the only folate form that can enter the brain and control serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which are linked to mood.\nAbout Pamlab\nFounded in 1957, Pamlab is a full pharmaceutical company with about 300 workers, specialized in prescription medical foods. Pamlab's products are sold across the country, helping hundreds of thousands of patients with depression, diabetic nerve pain, dementia, high-risk pregnancy, and other conditions.\nAbout Depression\nEach year, about 10% of the population, or more than 20 million American adults, will face depressive illness. MDD often comes back two or more times, with episodes that last two years or longer. Experts estimate that by 2020, depression will be the second leading cause of disability worldwide.\nSource: Pamlab",

Waring says the object is likely an ancient skull of one of many alien species on Mars before their civilization was destroyed millions of years ago. \nThe theory that an ancient Mars civilization was ended by a nuclear disaster is promoted by Dr. John Brandenburg, a plasma physicist with a PhD from the University of California at Davis. \nHe explained the idea in a paper titled, \"Evidence of Massive Thermonuclear Explosions in Mars Past, The Cydonian Hypothesis and Fermi’s Paradox.\" \nThe paper was first presented at the 2014 Annual Fall meeting of the American Physical Society, Prairie Section in Monmouth, Illinois. \nHe also presented the theory in March 2015, at the 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston, Texas, reported by Inquisitr. \nHe claimed there is evidence two ancient Mars civilizations — Cydonia and Utopia — were destroyed by nuclear explosions from hostile alien invaders. \nTalking more about the alien skull on Mars, UFO blogger Scott Waring says \"the skull is big, about the same size as a human skull.\" \n\"I don’t believe it is a helmet,\" he adds. \nHe says, \"A helmet would not have a perfectly formed nose area,\" and the ridges look like those found on Earth. \n\"The skull is big, about the same size as a human skull.\" \nParanormal Crucible's announcement about the alien skull on Mars led to many talks on alien and UFO conspiracy forums. \nSome alien hunters agreed with Waring and Paranormal Crucible that the object was likely an alien skull, while others thought it was an ancient military helmet. \nA few people who were unsure suggested that NASA should move the rover closer to the object for a better look, or use the rover’s robotic arm to check it. \n“I believe it is a helmet; petrified of course,” an alien enthusiast said. \n“We really need the rover to move over there and get a closer look,” another said, adding that using the rover arm to tip it over would help. \n“It looks like a helmet to me,” said a third person, agreeing with the first enthusiast. \n“I would say it looks more like a skull than a helmet,” a fourth person replied. \nOne enthusiast thought it “looks more like the head of a statue, not a skull. \nIt reminds me of old Greek style bronze statues where the eyes are empty.” \nBut others weren't sure what the object was. \n“I don’t know how true this may be, but it’s interesting nonetheless,” an enthusiast said. \nThere is uncertainty about whether the object is a skull or a helmet and the unlikelihood of NASA moving the Curiosity rover sparked protests and cover-up accusations against NASA. \n“We just want the truth! It’s not very hard?” a conspiracy theorist protested. \nIn the strange world of Mars research, an alien skull is not surprising. \nThe oddest find by Mars researchers was a live chicken on Mars. \nLess strange, but also odd, was the discovery of a fossil fish on Mars. \nBrave UFO hunters have found hundreds of crashed alien flying saucers and drones on Mars. \nOthers say they have found tree-like plants growing on Mars. \nOne alien hunter found a \"weaponized robotic machine\" on Mars earlier in the week. \nSome time ago, a creative UFO hunter found an alien handgun left on Mars by a careless visitor. \n[Image via Shutterstock]",

    "GPT_Result": "(CNN) — Taking selfies from about 12 inches away makes your nose look almost 30% bigger, says a report published Thursday in the journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery.\nResearchers now warn people that selfies are not a good way to decide on cosmetic procedures for their faces.\n“People, even my family, need to know that selfies don’t show how you truly look,” said Dr. Boris Paskhover, a facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and a main author of the study.\n“Selfies make your nose look wider and thicker when it’s not, and people prefer a smaller nose,” Paskhover added. “I worry that today’s generation doesn’t realize this. All they know are selfies.”\nSelfies have become a big part of our culture, helped by social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. In its first year, Google Photos had more than 25 billion selfies uploaded, according to Anil Sabharwal, vice president of Google Photos.\nRelated Content: Thousands Flock to Find Their Fine Arts Doppelganger in an App\nTo understand this, remember there are about 8 billion people on Earth.\nThe selfie trend might make people consider surgeries based on photos that change their looks, says Paskhover.\nIn a 2018 poll by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, 55% of surgeons had patients who wanted cosmetic changes to look better in selfies and social media photos in 2017, up from 42% in 2016.\nThe JAMA study used data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to estimate face sizes of people from various racial and ethnic groups in the US. Using math models, researchers found photos taken at 12 inches made nose size bigger by 30% in men and 29% in women compared to photos taken from a very far distance.\nPhotos taken from 5 feet away did not change the size of the nose significantly.\n“At 5 feet, how far the nose and face are from the camera is almost the same,” Paskhover said. “Because the difference is small, the nose doesn’t look distorted.”\nIn 2017, there were about 17.5 million cosmetic surgeries and minimally-invasive procedures in the US, a 2% rise from 2016 and a 200% rise from 2000, says a report by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\nOut of these, 218,924 were nose reshaping surgeries.\n“Overall, cosmetic surgeries are increasing,” said Dr. Jeffrey Janis, chief of plastic surgery at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. “They have gone up over the years and keep growing.”\n“I think we all know how social media greatly influences plastic surgery,” Janis added. “People share photos quickly with others they know and sometimes with strangers.”\nNose reshaping, or rhinoplasty, was the third most common cosmetic surgery in 2017. It usually costs $6,000 to $15,000 per surgery, according to Paskhover.\nBreast augmentation was the most common cosmetic surgery in 2017, with over 300,000 procedures. Liposuction, eyelid surgery, and tummy tucks also made the top five cosmetic surgeries last year, says the report.\n“I think people feel more open, less worried, about talking about plastic surgery without any social fear,” Janis added. “But I definitely believe there’s more interest because of selfie culture.”\nRhinoplasty and other plastic surgeries are usually safe, but like any surgery, there are risks. Complications like infection, poor wound healing, and skin color changes can happen in a few cases, says the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\nBut the biggest risk is a gap between what the patient expects and reality, says Janis.\n“The biggest risk in my mind is actually more about what the patient expects,” he said. “You must make sure, first, that the patient is a good candidate, and second, have a full talk with the patient about what results are realistic.”\nBoth Janis and Paskhover stressed that choosing a well-trained, board-certified plastic surgeon is crucial for any cosmetic procedure.\n“The biggest risk I see with rhinoplasty is if you choose someone without enough experience, results can vary,” Paskhover said.\n“It highlights the need for public safety,” Janis said. “You don’t want someone without proper training and who doesn’t work in a certified place to work on you.”",

    "GPT_Result": "Nine men are facing drug charges after officers in San Mateo County stopped two large vans with bales of marijuana worth $23 million. The marijuana had been taken off a boat from Mexico, investigators said Tuesday. \nThe case started Friday when officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security told the San Mateo County drug task force that marijuana boats might land on the coast, said District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe. \nAt 10:15 p.m. that night, two large vans drove into Año Nuevo State Park in Pescadero and met a \"panga\" fishing boat that arrived at the beach, Wagstaffe said. \nA group of men moved 180 bales of marijuana — weighing 5,148 pounds — from the boat to the vans, authorities said. Task force agents stopped the vans as they entered Highway 1. \nInvestigators found out that the boat had come from Mexico. Officers found a rubber raft, rain gear, and cell phones on the beach. The panga boat was found by the U.S. Coast Guard after a fisherman saw it in the water. \nThe men charged are Luis Farid Gonzalez, 20; Mario Gonzalez, 36; Juan Hernandez, 39; Juan Valdez Lopez, 50; Luis Espinoza Mendoza, 38; Estaban Flores Salazar, 39; Joan Sicairos, 29; Mark Richard Teixeira, 38; and Phin Yo Vorn, 33. \nExcept for Mario Gonzalez, all the men said they were not guilty Monday in Superior Court to charges of possessing marijuana for sale and importing marijuana into the state. They are held in County Jail with bail at $1 million each. \nThis case is similar to another incident on May 12, when drug smugglers left a panga boat, a car, and 42 bales of marijuana at Pescadero State Beach, 12 miles north of Año Nuevo, after the car got stuck in the sand. \nFollow @henryklee",

Chris Martin's wife was asked which piece of jewelry is most special to her during the evening. \"Probably my engagement ring,\" she answered. Gwyneth was joined by Jessica Biel, who looked stunning in an Elie Saab sheer halter-neck gown with blue and purple flowers in certain places. Her side-swept curls and a jewel-encrusted bracelet completed the Old Hollywood style. Kate Hudson caused a lot of photos to be taken as she arrived in a strapless duck-egg blue Reem Acra gown with a high split at the thigh. The 33-year-old actress looked great in the dress, matching it with sparkling Tiffany earrings and a nude clutch. Michelle Williams also went to the ball, which was held inside a 31-foot high Tiffany box made just for the event.

Some stars chose different colors, like Sarah Jessica Parker in a long gold gown and a black tuxedo jacket. The Sex and the City star talked about her Tiffany engagement ring, saying it is the most precious jewelry to her. \"I've told him countless times,\" she said, talking about her husband Matthew Broderick. Sarah also said she never buys jewelry because she can borrow it. \"I never bought jewelry,\" she said. \"I never think of it as an option.

For that and other actions being looked at, according to our rules, Pastor MacDonald was removed as senior pastor,\" the statement says. \nHarvest Bible Church's leaders ask for prayers during this hard time. \n\"We thank you deeply for your prayers, support, and patience as we try to bring back trust in leadership, show humility to follow biblical authority, and move forward as a church family. Please keep our church, the Elder Board, staff, and the MacDonald family in your prayers now,\" the statement ends. \nAs of Wednesday, Lifeway Books had taken all of MacDonald's books off its online catalog. \nThe Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) had also removed MacDonald's TV program \"Walk in the Word\" from its online schedule.",

The devices were first announced with an August 20 release date, but then their ship dates changed to August 27 online, making some people think there was a delay.\nRead: Droid Ultra, Droid Maxx & Droid Mini Hands-On Video.\nVerizon cleared things up, telling future buyers that the devices will still be in stores on August 20, but those who pre-ordered after the date change won’t get their devices shipped until later.\nThe good news is that people who pre-ordered these devices before the date change are seeing their devices shipped before the planned August 20 delivery dates. The screenshot below, sent to Gotta Be Mobile by someone, shows the Droid MAXX being picked up by FedEx a few hours ago.\nThe person tells us that the device should arrive on August 20, the same date given as a ship by date when the devices went up for pre-order. We can only confirm that the Droid MAXX is shipping, but we think the Droid Ultra, the other device coming on August 20, is shipping too. Motorola's third Droid smartphone, the Droid Mini, will come on August 29.\nThe Droid Ultra and Droid MAXX are entering a busy market as Verizon will carry the HTC One on August 22 and release the Moto X just a few days later. The carrier is also expected to get the iPhone 5S and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which should come in early September. Rumors also say the company will offer the rumored HTC One Max, a large-screen version of the HTC One.\nVerizon’s new Droids have some good features like high-resolution screens, fast processors, great cameras, and strong designs. The Droid MAXX also has a big battery that should give users up to 48 hours of battery life, more than the Droid RAZR MAXX HD.\nThanks to W for sending this in!",

    "GPT_Result": "When President Hu Jintao of China comes to Washington this week, many Americans will want Beijing to stop changing its currency unfairly. We feel we are being cheated a lot, but we need to think again. The bad effect of China’s currency, the renminbi, on lost jobs is smaller than we think. Changing the exchange rate should not be more important than other serious issues like North Korea, Iran, and two-way trade.\nSince last summer, China agreed to let its exchange rate be a little more flexible, and its currency has increased by only 3.6 percent against the dollar. This is because China, like the United States, also worries about jobs. By being slow with appreciation, China gives its exporters time to adapt, which limits job losses and controls social unrest.\nMany Americans think that keeping Chinese jobs with a low currency takes away American jobs. There are three common reasons for this idea.\nFirst, a stronger currency would make Chinese consumers able to buy more and would lower the cost of American goods in China, encouraging them to buy American products. Second, a stronger currency raises the cost of Chinese goods in other markets, like Europe or Latin America. If the renminbi goes up, consumers in other countries may avoid Chinese products and buy American ones instead. Third, a stronger currency would increase labor costs in China, making it less attractive for American companies to move jobs there and keeping more people working in America.\nThese claims, however, are more like hopeful thinking than real truths. Look at the first idea, that a stronger Chinese currency would help American exports grow in China. From 2005 to 2008, the renminbi went up nearly 20 percent against the dollar. Yet, American exports to China during those three years grew a bit slower than in the past three years when the renminbi did not rise at all (71 percent versus 89 percent).\nThis is because many of America’s main exports to China are capital-intensive goods like aerospace and power equipment. Price is just one of many factors for these buys, along with technology, quality, and service. Also, American businesses in these industries usually compete with European and Japanese firms, not Chinese ones. In the end, the dollar-euro and dollar-yen exchange rates might be more important for Chinese buying of American goods than the renminbi rate.\nSecond, I recently checked the top American exports to our 20 main foreign markets, and found little proof that a low Chinese currency harms American exports to other countries. This is mainly because American and Chinese companies compete directly in less than 15 percent of the top export products, such as network routers and solar panels. Mostly, we target different product markets; America markets airplanes and medicine while China sells electronics and textiles.\nLastly, it is not likely that a stronger renminbi would bring many jobs back to America. Instead, companies would probably move labor-intensive work to Vietnam, Indonesia, and other low-wage countries. And anyway, many skilled jobs will keep going abroad as long as cheaper talent is in places like India. Only in a few fields, like biomedical devices, would a strong Chinese currency mixed with quality issues make American companies want to keep more production at home.\nDon’t misunderstand me: China’s currency choices have caused unhealthy and fake changes in the Chinese and world economy. They also cause currency fights that could harm the teamwork needed for global recovery. While the effect on American workers is less than people think, workers in developing countries could gain much from a faster renminbi rise.\nWe should talk about currency issues with China, but the exchange rate should not be the most important topic. This issue suits the Group of 20 better since it is the world's problem, not just ours. Fixing our economic problems will depend more on reinvesting in education, transport, and other government services, and research, than on pushing China to change its currency.",

    "GPT_Result": "Naval Wives & Mistresses by Margarette Lincoln is 218 pages and published by the National Maritime Museum, costing £20. NAM Rodger, a famous British naval historian, said we need to research the women left ashore to complete the social history of the Georgian navy. The world of wooden warships is easy to study with technical details, hierarchies, and records, but where is the information to talk about the women? Margarette Lincoln, deputy director of the National Maritime Museum, wants to find this information while using men's rules about facts, like money and court records as evidence, and she has clearly worked hard to find it. \n\nIn the time of her book, from the mid-18th century to the end of the Napoleonic wars, people from high society wrote many letters. Although, the letters we have now are not complete, usually showing only one side of the conversation, and they were not always private as important people mixed in social circles. Lady Amelia Calder, wife of a rear admiral, wrote to the Admiralty: \"I hope you will not be so cruel tomorrow as you have been before, and please let us have proper letters by Tuesday's Post.\" From the First Lord of the Admiralty's reply, we can tell Lady Elizabeth Collins asked a lot for her son's promotion: \"Madam, I would like to help with the many requests for promotions, especially yours...\" The wives of high-ranking men did more than just ask for favors; they managed their homes while their husbands were away for years with slow mail delivery. Admiral Codrington sent notes telling his wife when to paint rooms; Mrs. Admiral Boscawen sent business reports to her husband and sent an image of him to Truro's officials. These wives had to be ready to suddenly travel to meet their husbands at ports, but often the ship sailed away before they got there.\n\nMoney and status were less of a worry for top-ranking officers compared to middle-class officers, for whom sea jobs were one of the few ways to quickly gain income and prize money. This idea is seen in Jane Austen's story \"Persuasion\" where Sir Walter Elliot did not like how the navy allowed people of lower birth to gain high positions and respect. Fictional Captain Wentworth returned from the wars with £25,000, but real rewards were often less certain; Austen's brother Charles did not earn much prize money and lived with his family on the ship, which likely led to his wife's death after childbirth. In middle-class stories, money problems appear often, like the worry of having only half-pay after peace or illness, and ship expenses could be so high that some couples could not afford to meet or send letters. William Wilkinson, a ship's master, told his wife Sally that everything he owned was hers, and he sold his flute for two and a half guineas to pay bills until he got his prize money.\n\nLike most of Lincoln's stories, the Wilkinsons' story ends suddenly after their financial trouble, maybe because nothing more was found, or because Lincoln shows her ideas by giving a human example of each, like separation or shipwreck fears. The lower on the social ladder, the shorter the story - Elenor Broderick, a boatswain's widow, asked her husband's captain to ask a charity for help because she and her children were \"in the greatest distress and Poverty.\" That is all. Below Elenor, there was little literacy to leave a mark, so Lincoln uses legal records about women hanged for false navy pay claims or the murder of a child before its father returned. Poor women left little record, except in songs and prints.\n\nLincoln keeps her theories abstract like women as consumers, gender roles, but these lives are best understood through everyday experiences. They made echoes rather than records. Sweet Poll of Plymouth, shown in a 1790 print as drunk and friendly with sailors, was well-known in areas around Plymouth when I was young: women like her were seen in local pubs and Beryl Cook paintings. If you grew up with morning calls like \"Wake up, show a leg,\" with sailors' belongings, and with family absent for long times and strong women, then you only need a line from a folk song to remember this world. If not, Lincoln's idea that relationships were influenced by local and cultural factors might not really bring this world to life for you.",

    "GPT_Result": "The Pont Alexandre III is Paris's most beautiful and grand bridge, and one of the nicest river crossings in the world. It was built for the Exposition Universelle of 1900, a world's fair that showed talking films, escalators, Russian nesting dolls, radio, and the most powerful telescope ever made. \nRudolf Diesel showed his new engine that ran only on peanut oil, and the city hosted the first Olympic Games outside of Greece. The fair also made the Art Nouveau style popular, and for the first time electric lights lit up the City of Light. \nThe bridge connects Les Invalides, where Napoleon's tomb is, on the Left Bank to the Champs-Élysées on the Right Bank. With views of the Eiffel Tower, it is a perfect place for wedding photos. Walking across the bridge is like walking through an open-air museum with many beautiful sculptures like lions, angels, and sea monsters. Lovely Art Nouveau lamps light up the bridge. \nFour pillars give balance to the bridge's arch without blocking the view. Each base has a sculpture showing France in a different time: King Charlemagne, the Renaissance, King Louis XIV, and modern times. \nGolden statues sit on top of the pillars and represent the Sciences, Arts, Commerce, and Industry, each with the horse Pegasus. \nAfter the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, a second wave of the industrial revolution brought wealth and cultural influence to France and especially Paris. Peace was in Europe for over 40 years, and people were optimistic. France's schools, hospitals, and science were the best in Europe, even with strong competition. \nThe bridge is named after Tsar Alexander III, who made a Russian alliance with France in 1892. The bridge celebrates the new relationship between France and Russia, whose aristocracy learned French as well as their own language. Alexander's son, Nicholas II, laid the bridge's first stone in October 1896. \nThe long, low arch of the Pont Alexandre III, with its Beaux Arts and Art Nouveau design, shows the Parisian Belle Époque (\"Beautiful Era\") from 1871 to 1914. During the Belle Époque, the arts thrived, and the Art Nouveau style, with its smooth lines, became a reaction against heavy decoration, influenced by Japanese art. The era got its name only later, after the hard times of the world wars. \nThe Pont Alexandre III is more than a bridge. With its beautiful art, it is one of the nicest places to visit in Paris.",

    "GPT_Result": "Women with lupus, an autoimmune disorder that can attack different tissues, were once advised not to get pregnant. Now, doctors give advice based on each patient's situation. However, it is often hard for doctors to know what risks their patient might face.\n\nA new study to understand these risks found that women with lupus during pregnancy, and even those soon to be diagnosed with lupus, are more likely to have preeclampsia, stroke, and infection than women without lupus. Babies born to mothers with lupus or pre-lupus are also more likely to be born early, have infections, or be small for their age, according to the paper published today in Arthritis Care and Research.\n\n\"We’ve confirmed previous findings while strengthening the data to show that lupus is linked with many bad pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and baby,\" said senior author Julia Simard, assistant professor of health research and policy at Stanford.\n\nThe research team, which worked with partners in Sweden and the U.S., used data from Swedish records. This information helped researchers find patients who had babies years before being diagnosed with lupus. Out of 13,598 first-time births, the team identified 551 women with lupus and 198 who were diagnosed within five years after giving birth.\n\nFor women not yet diagnosed, autoantibodies related to the disease might cause some of the bad outcomes, but the exact reasons are still not known, Simard said.\n\nShe and others are also trying to understand the clinical effects of the study, which might help improve doctors' advice and care for pregnant women with lupus and lead to earlier diagnoses.\n\nThis is a descriptive study, Simard warned. Lupus is hard to study because it can show up differently in each person. Like other diseases, it is also tough to separate conditions that could happen to anyone from those caused by lupus, she said.",

    "GPT_Result": "Sensitive story of a woman who thinks differently, a free spirit who changed Australian cinema.\nThe first book by Australian feminist Miles Franklin, written as a teenager and published in 1901, started more than one great career. Franklin wrote many famous books and became one of the country’s most important authors. Almost 80 years later, Judy Davis became famous after starring in director Gillian Armstrong’s excellent 1979 film version.\nDavis gives a strong performance as the stubborn main character Sybylla Melvyn. People often use “once in a lifetime” carelessly, but this important role deserves it. Davis won a Bafta award for her efforts and went on to have a long and impressive career.\n“Here is the story of my career. My brilliant career. I make no apologies for being egotistical because I am,” Sybylla says at the start, showing her proud and confident character that makes her one of the most memorable figures in Australian cinema. While dust flies in the outback around her, she writes in her diary about wanting to be part of the art and literature world.\nWith its sunny rural locations, it is clear from the start that My Brilliant Career is an Australian story set in an Australian setting. The film’s themes are broad (breaking free, being true to yourself) and its message about the importance and results of self-empowerment is timeless.\nAt the start, it is unclear if Sybylla’s “brilliant career” is just a wish or a dream that will come true by the end. Armstrong’s film (and the book it is based on) is strong because the end is both – and neither.\nSybylla’s dreams come true as she keeps her independence, stays true to herself, and expresses her creativity. But because of these things, the people around her, in a male-dominated world, doubt her success and her goals.\n“Useless, plain and godless” is how Sybylla’s mother describes her early in the film, while Armstrong shows Sybylla as a misunderstood free spirit fighting against the way things are. In the next scene, Sybylla talks to her sister under the stars about dreaming of a better life with adventure, books, and culture beyond the simple life of farming.\nA young woman dreaming of more than country life is a common story, but My Brilliant Career is a key work; it’s one of the first feminist stories about a woman living her own way before the women’s rights movement.\nEven with a heartfelt romantic part with Sam Neill as Harry Beecham – one of the few people who supports Sybylla – the film doesn’t replace her lonely strength with romance. She ends the film like it began, writing serious thoughts in her diary, after refusing Beecham’s marriage offer. The strength of the film and Sybylla’s story remains sadly unchanged.\nIt’s no surprise My Brilliant Career is seen as an important film in Australian feminist cinema. It is a strong story about old-fashioned Australia, sexism, and classism, and a sensitive story of a woman who thinks differently. Sybylla’s artistic dreams keep the film important and interesting to many people. Pressure from others comes in many forms, even in playing piano. She is told to “play the nice ones.”\nMy Brilliant Career isn’t “a nice one”. Like Sybylla, it is very unconventional. The film itself is a free spirit and has made a lasting mark on Australian cinema.",

Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) planned a vote on a bill for Jan. 24 that will need at least 60 votes to move on for debate and a final vote.\n• Web tax bill: A new Senate plan would allow states to collect sales taxes from out-of-state sellers even if they do not have a location in the state. The bill is supported by traditional stores and by former opponent Amazon.com, which improves its chances.\n• PNTR for Russia: Congress is likely to discuss a law to give permanent normal trade relations to Russia, a needed step for U.S. companies to get the full benefits from Russia joining the World Trade Organization.\n• China currency bill: The chances for this law are not sure, but it might progress this year if China's currency keeps falling against the dollar. The bill passed the Senate in October, but House leaders have not voted on it, saying it could start a trade war with China. The bill would tell the Commerce Department to treat low-value currency as an illegal export subsidy, which could lead to penalties on imports from China and other nonmarket economy countries.",

    "GPT_Result": "Chris Rock has been trying out his Oscar-night jokes at L.A. comedy clubs with good results, but he is not saying what he will do exactly.\nOn Monday, a fan tweeted that “You really killed it at the Comedy Store last night.” Rock also did stand-up at the Largo last Thursday at a show by Judd Apatow.\nCompared to other Oscar hosts, Rock has been quiet, but he posted two pictures on Instagram that look like hints. One picture shows him in a NASA astronaut suit with the words “Getting my outfit together,” and another shows him with Kristen Wiig and J.J. Abrams and says “Almost showtime.” Wiig and Abrams are part of the year’s biggest space movies, “The Martian” and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”\nWriting about the Largo show, Andy Wang from the Observer said Rock made jokes about diversity and other things, like Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, El Chapo, Oscar clothes, divorce, and dating. Wang chose not to share the jokes, but said one joke was about “how silly one boycott was, with a sharp punchline about two celebrities, but Rock knew it was too rude for the Oscars.”\nLast December, Rock talked with Essence magazine about women not being treated equally in Hollywood, especially women of color getting jobs. The March issue has an interview with Rock done before #OscarsSoWhite became bigger. He said, “I’ve never done a movie where someone didn’t ask ‘Does the girl have to be black?’ It happens every time. Black women get paid less in Hollywood.”\nWhile Jennifer Lawrence talked about pay differences in Hollywood, Rock said most black actresses “would love to be where Jennifer Lawrence is.”\nRock first hosted the Oscars 10 years ago, and was also quiet about it then. In a Feb. 14, 2005 interview with Variety, the show’s producer that year, Gil Cates, said people asked how he would “control” Chris Rock. Because of Rock’s HBO specials, Variety said he seemed “a raunchy choice.” But Cates answered: “He is very smart. His humor is mostly about ideas. He talks about race, business, and politics.”\nIn a review of the Oscar show, Brian Lowry from Variety liked Rock, saying he had a funny speech with jokes about the Bush Administration “but did not hurt anyone.”\nThis year, the Oscar show is made by Reginald Hudlin and David Hill. Hill, new to the Oscars but experienced with live TV, promised to Variety that they plan to finish the show on time. The Oscars will happen on Feb. 28 at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.",

The iPhone 6 is a very expected device, so everyone wants to know what new features this smartphone will have.  \nNew reports say that Apple will release the upcoming iPhone at an event on September 9. Some reports say that Apple will show two new iPhones at this event. Apple will present one iPhone with a 4.7-inch screen and another with a 5.5-inch screen.  \nReports also say that Apple will use a sapphire display in the iPhone 6. The new display might be shown in just one week. However, people have different ideas about what the new display will include. Some experts say the sapphire display might make the new iPhone more expensive.  \nSapphire is very costly to make, which might increase the iPhone's price by $100. But Apple always tries to make strong, scratch-resistant screens, so they might choose quality, even if it costs more.  \nExperts also say that the sapphire display will help customers because it makes the screen more resistant and durable. A strong screen means people might not need screen protectors. Sapphire is the toughest material available.  \nUsing sapphire is not a new idea for the iPhone. Sapphire is already used in the home button's fingerprint scanner and to cover the camera. If Apple uses this technology in the new iPhone, it will solve the issue of screens breaking easily when dropped. We will have to wait and see how much this feature will cost.",

Parent company Toyota Motor Corp wants its minicar subsidiary to help it grow in new markets and make cheaper, good-quality cars.\nToyota, the world’s second-biggest automaker, wants to use its smaller partner’s skill in making affordable, reliable small cars for its own passenger models. This is because it is facing higher costs and tough global competition to make more advanced cars.\n“There’s a market for small cars in places like Brazil,” Daihatsu President Soichiro Okudaira told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday.\n“Toyota sells similar models in Asia and South America. Brazil has been important for models like the Corolla, though they are a bit bigger.”\nOkudaira, who was the lead engineer of the last two Corolla models, was sent from Toyota to lead Daihatsu this month. He did not give more details on when or how they would expand in Brazil.\nToyota has about 9 percent market share in Brazil. There it sells the Etios subcompact hatchback, the Corolla, Camry sedans, SUVs, and trucks. Expanding there means competing with leaders FCA, General Motors Co, and Volkswagen AG.\nBrazil is a top-10 global car market but could be tough to expand in. This is because a deepening recession and political issues have hurt car sales in recent years. The country sold about 2 million cars in 2016, down from 3.5 million in 2010.\nDaihatsu is Japan’s largest minicar maker. These have engines no bigger than 660cc and are cheaper than passenger cars. Toyota already asked Daihatsu to help make small cars for new markets like India.\nToyota President Akio Toyoda said last month he was counting on minicar technology to make normal cars cheaper. Toyota has created in-house companies to focus on small cars and new markets, which are big markets for smaller models.\nOkudaira said the two companies are still thinking about their plan for India and other new markets. This includes deciding whether to launch small cars under Daihatsu or Toyota brands and ensuring a good-quality supply chain.\nToyota has had a hard time growing its share in India’s low-cost car market, which Suzuki Motor Corp, a domestic rival, dominates.

    "GPT_Result": "Coca-Cola has had a difficult time recently. The company gave investors a 42% return in the last five years, including dividends, while the S&P gave an 87% return. Coca-Cola's performance is worse compared to PepsiCo, which gave investors a 90% return, twice as much as Coca-Cola.\n\nIn the third-quarter conference call, CEO James Quincey mentioned three main ideas for growth. The last idea received the most attention: We are looking for chances in premium segments like adult craft drinks. More adult consumers want special products with unique flavors, quality ingredients, and small-scale production.\n\nLater, after much media interest, Quincey said moving into alcohol does not make sense now. He suggested Coca-Cola should stop thinking about alcohol and instead buy all of Monster Beverage Corporation. \n\nAcquisitions are important for growth for both Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Pepsi's strong performance is not new as it started over 50 years ago. In 1965, Pepsi merged with Frito-Lay, and since then, it bought drinks like Tropicana and SoBe for growth. Recently, as soda sales fell, Pepsi's other brands have become more important. \n\nCoca-Cola has mainly focused on drinks and recently started buying companies to grow. In 2015, Coca-Cola bought 16.7% of Monster and partnered to grow Monster's global reach. \n\nCoca-Cola can see how profitable its stake in Monster is. In a recent report, the value of its Monster investment is $5.6 billion, while the price paid was $3.4 billion. If Coke sold Monster shares now, it would gain $2.3 billion, or 68%, before tax.\n\nWhile alcohol talk got more media attention, Quincey's other growth ideas are important. The first was to find high-growth brands; the second was to expand small brands internationally, through in-house efforts or partnerships. Although Monster is not a small brand with its $34 billion market cap, it is growing a lot.\n\nIn the quarter ended Sept. 30, Monster's revenue grew 15.4% with 36% growth internationally. In the conference call, Monster CEO Rodney Sacks said: We trust our growth strategy and will continue to grow our brands and expand abroad, especially with Coke's help.\n\nCoca-Cola can grow through an acquisition without buying new companies or going into new markets. To fully integrate Monster, Coca-Cola would need a \"control stake,\" usually 50% or more. In the future, this could be a smart investment.",

    "GPT_Result": "This is a post from The Young Austinian by Katherine Hysmith, part of POPSUGAR Select Food. \nI know what you will say. \"Butternut squash in an enchilada?! Are you serious?\" But there's a good reason—and delicious enchiladas—behind this idea; let me explain. \nDo you know the Native American story of the Three Sisters? It is about three crops—corn, squash, and beans—that grow well together and are a complete vegetarian protein. \nIn many Native groups, these plants grew together, as corn gave beans something to climb, and beans gave nitrogen back to the soil. The squash, with big leaves, covered the ground and stopped weeds. \nThe amino acids in beans and squash help us get nutrients from corn that we can't get alone. \nIf you serve these enchiladas with beans—FYI, not doing so is wrong south of the Red River—you have a complete meal. Sweet, food scholar logic. \nI know you’re thinking, \"Are these fancy vegetarian enchiladas?\" Yes, they are, but also much more. \nWhen roasted squash mixes with cheese, it makes a gooey filling with red sauce spice that makes you forget plain cheese enchiladas. \nI almost don't want to tell you, but you will be eating vegetables you might not eat usually. \nI, The Young Austinian, do not like squash, but with enough cheese and a fun story, I will eat it. \nSince these take time to put together, you can make these early (saving the last step) and keep them in the fridge (for a day or so). \nThe sauce is also easy to make ahead and tastes good on anything Tex-Mex. \nThese butternut squash enchiladas are a good vegetarian dish for people who do not like turkey at Friendsgiving or Thanksgiving dinners.",

    "GPT_Result": "Researchers at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa have created new methods that may greatly affect research on congenital cervical vertebrae problems. In the main article of the November issue of Molecular Reproduction and Development, researchers studied cervical vertebrae issues in humans, which can cause nerve issues and increase the chance of stillbirth in women. Research on abnormal vertebrae development has been hard because there are no lab animals similar to humans and there are limits on research with human subjects. Dr. Jinzeng Yang, who is a molecular biologist in the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources’ Department of Human Nutrition, Food and Animal Sciences, led the research. Researchers from Yang’s lab created a new mouse model that shows how certain proteins can affect cervical vertebrae development. The mouse model uses a method that turns off certain genes to form the skeleton. The mice seem normal but have unusual cervical vertebrae formation. Yang’s gene suppression method has benefits over another method where genes are completely removed, which causes mice to die soon after birth. Yang’s lab has been researching myostatin, a protein that reduces muscle mass. By stopping myostatin with part of its DNA, mice were made with 40% more muscle. Yang’s student Zicong Li, who is the first author, thought that stopping a similar protein, GDF11, would help skeleton growth and produce live mice. In the past, mice missing the GDF11 gene died shortly after birth. Working with Dr. Stefan Moisyadi’s lab at the UH Institute of Biogenesis Research, they made the transgenic mice using a new system that delivers genes more accurately. The original research article is called, “Transgenic Over-Expression of Growth Differentiation Factor 11 Propeptide in Skeleton Results in Transformation of the Seventh Cervical Vertebra into a Thoracic Vertebra.” You can read the publication online at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrd.21252/full.

It announced new Series B funding from Verizon Investments, bringing the total to $8 million.  \nThe company had earlier raised $6 million in Series B funding led by Digicel Group, with SVG Partners, Storm Ventures, and True Ventures also joining. In 2012, Flint raised $3 million from Storm and True Ventures.  \nThe investment from Verizon is interesting because Flint already has funds from Digicel, a wireless provider in the Caribbean and South Pacific. The new funds from Verizon will help Flint develop its product and get more customers.  \nGreg Goldfarb, co-founder and CEO of Flint Mobile, says mobile operators like their focus on full mobility for businesses and like digital app models. They understand the distribution and adoption problems with hardware accessories.  \nFlint’s app for iOS and Android is for merchants and businesses outside traditional stores but who need to process card transactions, invoices, and receipts. It now also lets users handle cash and checks with the new update.  \nThe update, first for iOS users, allows merchants to send invoices for online payment by mobile or tablet, without waiting for checks or transfers. Flint tracks overdue invoices and sends reminders.  \nMerchants can now make coupons in the app for Apple’s Passbook, which can be emailed to customers. Customers add them to Passbook or use a QR code. Merchants can remind customers before coupons expire.  \nFlint now supports multiple items, custom payment amounts, and discounts in transactions.  \nAndroid users can use the invoicing option online now, but other features will come to Android soon.  \nFlint is competitive on fees; it charges 1.95% for Visa and MasterCard debit transactions and 2.95% for credit cards. It does not support AmEx and Discover like others do.  \nFlint offers features like social marketing tools, letting businesses make Facebook referrals through emailed receipts.  \nFlint has about 200,000 installs, mostly on iOS. Android was launched in October. Transaction volumes have grown by 14 times since early 2013, with an average transaction of around $100.  \nFlint users include beauty and fitness services, contractors, photographers, healthcare, consultants, and direct sales. They are attracted to Flint because they don’t need hardware to start accepting payments.",

    "GPT_Result": "KABUL (Reuters) - Enayatullah Balegh is a professor at Kabul University. He also talks on Fridays in the biggest mosque in central Kabul, where he supports jihad against foreigners who disrespect Islam. \nLast month, a U.S. pastor burned a copy of the Koran, making many ordinary people feel that many foreigners in Afghanistan are infidels. \n“The international community and the American government are responsible for this big insult to Muslims,” Balegh told Reuters at the Hazrat Ali mosque. \n“I tell my students to fight against all foreigners who disrespect our religious values. We have had enough.” \nProtests in Kabul against the Koran-burning have been peaceful, but many other mullahs in the crowded capital criticize the foreigners who fight and work in Afghanistan. \nIn Kabul’s northwest, Habibullah Asaam tells his people that contact with non-Muslims is dangerous. \n“The Jews and crusaders can never be friends of Muslims, they ruin our society and culture,” he said during Friday talks. People shouted “Allahu Akbar” -- God is greatest -- in answer. \n“Those who want them here are cowardly Muslims. Women do not wear veils, men follow fashion and show off, it’s all because of the foreigners,” he said. \nWith few Dari or Pashto-speaking foreigners in the country, the messages from mosques by loudspeakers often go unnoticed by the people they talk about. \nBut the strong anti-Western feeling was clear last week when a protest in peaceful Mazar-i-Sharif city ended with the killing of seven foreign U.N. workers. \nProtesters listened for hours to clerics like Abdul Rahoof Tawana, who told them “we must get revenge for the Koran burning.” \nAfter the attack, the provincial governor asked imams to stop talking about politics and told police to collect audio tapes with “hate” speeches. \nDEEP INFLUENCE \nIn a very religious country where most men attend Friday prayers, sermons are important for trying to stop insurgents from religious schools and mosques who claim a religious high ground.\nWhile there is no formal church structure like Christian churches, the government has some control over the imams. \nIt pays the salaries of many imams, President Hamid Karzai has powerful clerics among his advisers -- Tawana is a member of Afghanistan’s council of senior clerics -- and speech notes are given to some imams by the Religious Affairs Ministry. \n“Sometimes mullahs speak beyond what we want but we have no resources to control all mosques in the country,” Israr-ul-Haq, a deputy for the department of Mosques and Other Holy Sites, told Reuters. \nHe said there are about 160,000 mosques in the country, but only 3,000 are registered with the government. Others are built by locals, and their imams are supported by the community, he said. \n“Mullahs have their own problems. If they speak against the government, security forces harass or detain them,” Israr-ul-Haq said. “If they speak for the government, insurgents kill them.” \nKarzai seems not strong enough to challenge powerful clerics, and it is hard to check sermons in thousands of smaller mosques in remote areas. \nIn rural areas where the Taliban are active, Friday sermons often support the insurgency. \nKhan Mohammad, an elder in southern Helmand province, said insurgents tell imams to call NATO troops “foreign invaders” and the government a puppet. \nAmong those who were far away, and those at the Mazar riots but not part of the killing, many did not criticize the violence. And although insurgents had a role, it was regular protesters who helped attack the U.N. compound and find the victims. \nAfter billions of dollars and nearly 10 years of war, where diplomats highlight rebuilt schools, clinics, and an army with Western help, the anger leading to such killings is hard for Westerners to face.\nAnti-Western feeling is strong in Afghanistan, which is conservative, deeply religious, and wary of outsiders. The welcome foreign troops got in 2001 has slowly turned negative. \n“There is a lot of anger after years of Western military actions causing many civilian deaths,” wrote Thomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts’ Network, in an article on the killing. \nThe rich lives of many Westerners and officials seen as corrupt do not help. Ordinary people see little benefit from aid money and face human rights abuses, adding to anger. \n“As if air strikes on civilians, violence, and bloodshed were not enough, now they have burned the Koran,” said Tawab Rustami, a 24-year-old university student.\n“The conflict is because of the foreigners, it is better for them to leave before things get worse,” he said.",

    "GPT_Result": "Paris, France /AFP/. French President Emmanuel Macron will offer to loan Britain a famous tapestry showing the French conquest of England during his visit to the UK on Thursday.   \nThe 40-year-old French leader likes to use symbolism and gifts in his diplomacy to show France's strength as a world power.  \nDuring a visit to Beijing, he gave the Chinese president a French horse, and last year he showed Russian leader Vladimir Putin around an exhibition at the Versailles Palace.  \nIn Britain on Thursday, Macron will offer to send the 70-metre-long Bayeux Tapestry to Britain for the first time, though this will be hard because it is a fragile, thousand-year-old artwork.  \n\"It will not be before 2020 because it's a very delicate cultural treasure that needs major restoration work before being moved anywhere,\" an official in Macron's office said Wednesday.  \nThe tapestry, made around 1077, shows the Battle of Hastings when William the Conqueror from France defeated English forces in England.  \nThe story of the military defeat in 1066, where English King Harold died from a French arrow, is still taught to British children and is important in the history of Anglo-French rivalry.  \n- Gallic joke? -\nMany historians and politicians on Monday welcomed the gesture as a friendly act showing the two countries' shared history during a time when Britain is leaving the European Union.  \n\"It's an absolutely fantastic opportunity for British people to come, I hope to the British Museum, and see it in all its glory,\" said Tom Tugendhat, chairman of a foreign affairs committee in the British parliament.  \n\"This is a real example of how diplomacy works,\" he told BBC radio.  \nBut other commentators wondered why Macron focused on a bad moment in British military history.  \nThe Times newspaper published a cartoon showing Macron dressed as a Middle Ages soldier attacking British Prime Minister Theresa May: \"Emmanuel The Conqueror: It's One In The Eye for Theresa Regina.\"  \nWriting on Twitter, journalist Robert Peston commented that \"lending the UK a great depiction of the last time this country was invaded is a funny French joke by Emmanuel Macron.\"  \n- Argument over origins -\nThe loan might also restart a disagreement about who made the tapestry, which has rarely left its museum in Bayeux, France.  \nIt was shown in Paris in 1804 and briefly at the Louvre Museum in 1945.  \n\"There is a reasonable case that it could have been made in Canterbury\" in England, British historian David Musgrove, who wrote a book on the topic, told the BBC.  \n\"There are many stylistic elements in the tapestry which suggest this.\"  \nSome think it was made in Bayeux itself or maybe in an abbey in the Loire region of France.  \nFrench historian Pierre Bouet said the tapestry should be seen by Britons as showing France's role in their history.  \nThe tapestry \"reminds people of the military achievements of the founder of the current royal family,\" Bouet told AFP. \"Even if he doesn't directly descend from him, Prince Charles knows he has William the Conqueror's blood.\"  \nThe British royal family still has the French words \"Dieu Et Mon Droit\" (God and my Right\") on its coat of arms.  \nThe story of the loan was first reported in British media by the BBC and The Times.  \nMacron will talk with May at a Britain-France summit at Sandhurst, a British military academy outside London, on Thursday.  \nThe discussions are expected to focus on migration, Britain's needs during negotiations to leave the EU, and increased defence cooperation.",

    "GPT_Result": "Sure, the steamy start to ABC's \"Monday Night Football\" was exciting, showing the bare back of \"Desperate Housewives\" actress Nicollette Sheridan as she jumped into football player Terrell Owens' arms. But U.S. regulators decided Monday the racy clip did not break federal indecency rules. In a group decision, the five-member Federal Communications Commission said the clip \"is not graphic or explicit enough to be indecent under our standard.\" A spokesman for ABC sports, Mark Mandel, said the company would not comment. The clip shown last November had Sheridan in a locker room wearing just a towel and asking Philadelphia Eagles player to skip the game for her. She then dropped the towel and jumped into Owens' arms. Only the top of the \"Desperate Housewives\" star's back was shown, and no bad language was used — the scene was similar to what is often seen on soap operas. But ABC said it got complaints from viewers who thought it was not proper. While agreeing with the decision, Democratic Commissioner Michael Copps criticized ABC for showing the clip at 9 p.m. EST when many kids were watching. \"There wasn't much self-discipline in this promotion,\" he said. \"Broadcasters can and should do better.\" Federal law stops non-satellite radio stations and non-cable TV channels from showing certain sexual and bathroom-related content between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. when children might be watching. While the federal indecency law has been around for many years, the FCC has enforced it more strictly in the last 18 months. This was especially true after February 2004 when Janet Jackson's right breast was briefly shown in the Super Bowl halftime show. The FCC suggested a $550,000 fine against CBS, which showed the Super Bowl. The network is appealing. After the Jackson incident, some networks started using a delay on live shows to stop any bad content before it aired. Congress is considering making fines for indecency much higher. Last month, the House passed a bill to raise the maximum fine from $32,500 to $500,000. A similar bill has been given to the Senate but has not been discussed yet.",

    "GPT_Result": "Twitter, Facebook, Google+, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Email\nTrump approved a $717 billion NDAA budget for 2019, but full money approval must wait until Congress passes the 2019 government budget. Right now, the bill plans to make helicopters a key part of the United States’ defense plan. These helicopters focus a lot on anti-submarine tech and use current military tools for defense.\n\nHelicopters Meet Submarines\nPeople often see helicopters as transport vehicles, good for places without airports, but military helicopters can do much more. Helicopters are good for finding enemy submarines because they can fly low to the water to detect them and work from ship bases. If the helicopter does not stop the submarine, their own base could be at risk.\n\nThe US military is worried about Russian submarines now; all of NATO is worried about Russia's submarines. Because of improvements a few years ago, US helicopters can now track Russian and Chinese submarines. NATO members have spent more time practicing submarine tracking and targeting lately.\n\nFurther Advances Expected\nBesides past improvements to military helicopters, the Navy plans mid-life upgrades on anti-submarine warfare tools starting in FY 2020. These upgrades will use new tech like Doppler navigation, replacing old systems on the Apache Longbow GPS and INS. These systems are similar to the old GPS, so they reduce training costs and work with current systems, and like other US military tech, they might be popular worldwide.\n\nCompeting National Interests\nA big worry with better military tech is that few changes are secret now, so other countries want the same equipment. For example, India wants to buy MH-60 Romeos, US military helicopters for hunting submarines, while the 2019 NDAA had rules against doing business with Chinese company ZTE, but Trump said the ban would be lifted. Secrecy in security and military tools is rare now, changing war preparations.\n\nOther Helicopter Advances\nBesides submarine tech, US military helicopters may get other improvements in 2019-2020, like self-flying tech in development for four years, better obstacle avoidance with LIDAR, and crash prevention tools. These tools follow the Army's idea of \"mission adaptive autonomy,\" which lets the helicopter handle basic flying while the pilot focuses on complex tasks, like helping injured soldiers or supporting ground troops.\n\nHelicopters often do not get as much attention as fighter planes in military spending talks, but they are just as important for defense. The 2019 NDAA shows that clearly by focusing on improving helicopter technology, so the upcoming military budget should control costs and give the military tools to protect the country. \n\nRelated Content\nShop Google",

    "GPT_Result": "The awareness day on rheumatoid arthritis organized by the Kuwait Association of Rheumatology on 1 February 2014 at the 360 Mall in Kuwait was a big success because many people gathered there. The event aimed to raise awareness about the disease and was open to the public from 3 to 7 pm. Participants liked the event and went home knowing more about rheumatoid arthritis. Many people, including officials from the Ministry of Health of Kuwait and corporate sponsors, praised the success of the event. \n\nThere was a short program where officials and VIPs from the Ministry of Health, the association, and sponsors were recognized. After a short message from the minister, Prof. Adel Al Awadhi, a Professor of Medicine and President of Kuwait Association of Rheumatology, also spoke. Many top companies in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, like Newbridge Pharmaceuticals, Abbvie, Roche, and Pfizer, supported the event. After the opening ceremony, participants learned general information about rheumatoid arthritis and how to find and treat it early. \n\nAnother area focused on patients with rheumatoid arthritis where experts gave information on better disease control. The event was fun and educational, with a special area for kids, a photo wall, and four raffle draws with gifts for lucky visitors. \"We are very happy that such an important event about educating the public on rheumatoid arthritis had great public response,\" Prof. Adel Al Awadhi said. He thanked the Ministry of Health of Kuwait and sponsors for their support. He emphasized the need to continue such events to reach more people in Kuwait. He expressed hope for future events due to continued support from the Kuwaiti government and sponsors. \n\nRheumatoid arthritis affects about 1% of adults and is more common in women at a ratio of 3:1. Studies show 90% of patients can develop disability after two decades without proper treatment. It is an inflammatory, autoimmune disease where the body attacks its joints, causing pain and stiffness, especially in the morning. Over time, it damages the cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and can even erode bone ends, leading to joint deformity and disability. \n\nFor more information, please contact:\nAmna Al Jarery/ Laila Al Tarawnah\nAction PR Group\nTel: +9652491561",
