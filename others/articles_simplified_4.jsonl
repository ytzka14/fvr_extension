{"cluster": 31, "text": "Determina, which makes intrusion-prevention products, made an unofficial fix for the Microsoft Web browser available on Monday. The release came shortly after eEye Digital Security issued its own temporary patch.\nBoth fixes are meant to protect Windows PCs against cyberattacks that exploit a recently disclosed IE vulnerability Microsoft has yet to provide an update for. The software maker has not endorsed either fix, saying that as a rule it doesn't recommend installing outside patches.\nThis is the second time this year that somebody has beaten Microsoft to the punch with a security fix. Last time, security experts supported a patch issued by a European researcher.

Only those people who need to use Active Scripting in IE should consider adopting an unofficial solution, he said.\nThe vulnerability has to do with how Internet Explorer handles the \"createTextRange()\" tag in Web pages.

These sites typically install spyware, remote control software and Trojan horses on vulnerable PCs, according to security company Websense.\nAndreas Marx, an antivirus software specialist at the University of Magdeburg in Germany, said the security issue with IE is significant, but agreed that a third-party fix is not needed. \"I would not apply this patch personally,\" he said. \"As long as you're not using IE, you're safe. If you do use it, you should deactivate Active Scripting.\"\nActive Scripting, also known as ActiveX Scripting, is used to deliver \"feature-rich\" Web sites that can run small applications. Disabling the component in IE can have an impact on how well Web sites function in the browser.\nHeeding the expert advice, Susan Bradley, a network administrator at an accountancy firm in Fresno, Calif., said she is not deploying any unofficial patch. \"When any of these third-party patches are considered, one needs to think about supportability.

{"cluster": 75, "text": "Kathleen Brooks\nTHE recent wobble in the financial markets highlights the fragile state of the economic recovery. One minute risky assets looked like they will perform strongly, and the next investors were rushing to safe-havens. What investors look for in this environment is a safe-haven asset with risk-like characteristics.\nPlatinum and palladium could be just the ticket. Firstly, they tend to perform well in both a risk-seeking and a risk- averse environment. Both metals act like safe-havens and tend to be bought by investors when there is a pullback in risk sentiment. But they are also used by the industrial sector, for example, in catalytic converters for cars, hard drives and for crowns that are used in dentistry.\nDue to this, supply factors can also weigh on platinum and palladium prices. Precious metal reserves have been falling in recent years, partly because production and exploration costs have risen rapidly, but also because fears about profitability, especially for palladium, has made investment opportunities less attractive.\nA shortage of supply is only problematic if there is enough demand to drive the price of the metal higher. And there are signs that demand for palladium and platinum will increase in the coming years, fuelled by growth in emerging markets. Consumers across Asia now want to own cars; in fact, auto sales in China surged past those in the US last year. And this could be just the tip of the iceberg as the middle classes, especially in China and India, continue to expand, boosting consumption in these countries.\nBut why should investors trade palladium and platinum instead of the more well-known precious metals like gold or silver? Julius Baer, the Swiss fund manager, recommends the lesser-known metals not only because they are regarded as safe-havens, but, because platinum and palladium have an industrial use, they are more than just “crisis metals”.\nInvestors might also be wary about entering into a long gold position when the price is currently more than 20 per cent higher than a year ago. In contrast, platinum and palladium prices have both underperformed gold and silver in recent years, with palladium remaining fairly flat.\nA long position in the metal can help the risk-reward ratio of a portfolio, according to Julius Baer. It argues that precious metals, including platinum and palladium, have low correlations to other asset classes. However, it recommends a long-term investment because precious metals can be very volatile in the short-term.\nBut for investors with little trading experience or knowledge of palladium or platinum, then an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a good way to test the water. An ETF takes away the hassle of buying the physical metal – such as checking its purity and storing it – since you can trade an ETF just like a share. Also, you can buy shares in an ETF in relatively small amounts, which is wise for a novice platinum and palladium trader.\nDeborah Fuhr, global head of ETF research for BlackRock, the asset manager, says that investors need to do their research if they are thinking about investing in an ETF.\nInvestors should find out what their chosen ETF is actually invested in, says Stephan Mueller, executive director of the Julius Baer Precious Metals Funds. Sometimes ETFs don’t hold the physical commodity; instead they own notes or certificates that are the equivalent of a claim on the metal, which is actually owned by a bank or another financial institution. “If you are invested in notes then this means that you have counterparty risk,” says Mueller. Thus, the ETF is not a true reflection of the safe-haven status of platinum and palladium.\nMueller would also avoid investing in ETFs with exposure to the miners of precious metals, since the sector is inherently risky: “Not only do you have geopolitical risk in the areas that resources are located, but you also have political risk and the threat that a government could nationalise your assets.”\nFor retail investors, it can be worth expanding your investment horizon to include palladium and platinum, along with traditional assets. But make sure you do your homework first.\n", "sentence_count": 31, "List": "1k", "unknown_words": ["according", "argues", "asia", "asset", "assets", "attractive", "auto", "averse", "avoid", "baer", "blackrock", "boosting", "brooks", "catalytic", "cent", "certificates", "characteristics", "china", "claim", "commodity", "consumers", "consumption", "contrast", "converters", "correlations", "counterparty", "crisis", "crowns", "currently", "deborah", "demand", "dentistry", "director", "due", "economic", "emerging", "environment", "equivalent", "etf", "etfs", "example", "exchange", "executive", "expand", "expanding", "exploration", "exposure", "factors", "financial", "fragile", "fuelled", "fuhr", "fund", "funds", "geopolitical", "global", "hassle", "havens", "highlights", "homework", "horizon", "iceberg", "include", "including", "increase", "india", "industrial", "inherently", "institution", "invested", "investing", "investment", "investors", "julius", "kathleen", "knowledge", "located", "metal", "metals", "miners", "mueller", "novice", "opportunities", "palladium", "per", "perform", "physical", "platinum", "political", "portfolio", "precious", "production", "profitability", "pullback", "purity", "rapidly", "ratio", "recommends", "recovery", "reflection", "regarded", "relatively", "remaining", "research", "reserves", "resources", "retail", "reward", "risk", "risky", "rushing", "sales", "sector", "seeking", "sentiment", "silver", "status", "stephan", "supply", "surged", "swiss", "threat", "thus", "ticket", "tip", "trade", "traded", "trader", "trading", "traditional", "underperformed", "volatile", "wary", "weigh", "wise", "wobble"], "simplified": "Kathleen Brooks  \nThe recent fluctuations in financial markets underscore the economic recovery's fragility. Risky assets' performance can quickly shift, pushing investors towards safe-havens. In this context, platinum and palladium emerge as appealing options due to their ability to perform well in both risk-seeking and risk-averse conditions. Additionally, these metals are used in industrial applications, such as catalytic converters and dental crowns, which influence their prices.  \n\nDespite declining precious metal reserves due to rising production costs and profitability concerns, especially for palladium, demand is expected to rise, driven by emerging markets' growth. For instance, as the middle classes in China and India expand, car ownership increases, boosting consumption of these metals.\n\nJulius Baer, a Swiss fund manager, suggests investing in platinum and palladium over traditional metals like gold due to their industrial use and lower correlations with other asset classes, which can enhance a portfolio's risk-reward ratio. Unlike gold, which has seen a significant price increase, platinum and palladium have remained relatively stable, making them attractive for long-term investment despite short-term volatility risks.  \n\nFor inexperienced investors, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a practical entry point by removing the complexities of buying physical metals. However, as Deborah Fuhr from BlackRock advises, investors must research their chosen ETFs thoroughly. Stephan Mueller of Julius Baer warns that some ETFs might hold notes instead of physical commodities, posing a counterparty risk that could undermine their safe-haven status. He also advises against ETFs linked to mining stocks due to geopolitical and political risks.  \n\nInvestors should consider expanding their portfolios to include platinum and palladium alongside traditional assets, but they should conduct thorough research beforehand.", "simplified2": "Kathleen Brooks  \nRecent events in money markets show the delicate state of the economy. At first, risky money options seemed strong, but then people sought safer choices. In this setting, people want a safe option that still carries some risk. \n\nPlatinum and palladium might be the answer. They do well both when people want to take risks and when they're cautious. Both metals are seen as safe choices and are used in industry, like in devices for cars and dental tools. \n\nThe supply of these metals impacts their prices. Precious metal stores have dropped recently due to increased costs and concerns over profits, especially with palladium, which makes investing seem less appealing. \n\nSupply issues are a problem only when there's demand to push prices up. Demand for these metals is expected to grow, mainly due to rising markets. More people in Asia now want cars. For instance, car purchases in China have surpassed those in the US. This trend is likely to continue as middle-class groups in China and India grow, increasing buying habits.\n\nSo, why pick palladium and platinum over more famous metals like gold or silver? Swiss money manager Julius Baer suggests these lesser-known metals not just because they're safe options, but also due to their industrial uses. \n\nHigh gold prices might deter people from buying more gold. Meanwhile, platinum and palladium haven't risen as much as gold and silver lately, with palladium staying fairly steady. \n\nHolding onto these metals can help balance the potential for gains and losses in a money plan. Julius Baer says these metals often move differently compared to other options. Still, a long-term approach is better, given the quick price changes in the short term.\n\nFor new investors or those unfamiliar with palladium or platinum, buying into a fund that follows these metals is a good start. This avoids the hassle of obtaining the metal itself. Plus, you can buy fund shares in smaller amounts, which is smart for beginners.\n\nDeborah Fuhr from BlackRock, an asset manager, stresses the importance of research when investing in funds. Knowing what a fund actually holds is key. Stephan Mueller of Julius Baer explains that some funds aren't backed by the real metal but by notes tied to the metal, creating extra risk if the note issuer fails. Thus, such funds may not fully represent the safety of platinum and palladium.\n\nMueller advises avoiding funds connected to metal mining since the field is risky due to political issues and other threats. For casual investors, adding palladium and platinum to usual investments could be beneficial, but one should always understand the details first.", "simplified3": "The recent financial market fluctuations reveal the fragility of the economic recovery..

Mix in a palace, a designer wardrobe, a prince in uniform, a horse-drawn carriage and you have a made-for-Disney fairytale.\nBut something’s happening at the royal banquet table. It looks like the Duchess has forgotten to eat.\nThin may well be in her DNA — her mom and sis are athletic slim-jims, too — and she clearly tried to slim down in the months before the wedding, but recent post-honeymoon snapshots show that she seems to be shrinking by the day. Photos, for instance, like the ones that accompanied the couple’s latest official outing on Thursday at an London gala for a children’s charity show a Kate (pictured, with her prince) who is barely there.\nBarely there, and starting to get the unhealthy, gaunt look that so defines the look of a young woman who’s, well, starving.\nDoes it matter if the Duchess is so thin that her head is starting to look like the widest part of her body? It shouldn’t, but societal demands are such that women — especially women of profile, be they politicians, news anchors, movie stars or royalty — are pressured by constant messages everywhere they look that in order to be attractive and successful and accepted they must be thin. Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels, said waif-like model Kate Moss. I’ve never eaten a cookie, said rail-thin Spice Girl Victoria Beckham.\nIt’s the pressure and the expectation of achieving the coveted size 0, one can only surmise, that finds actress Angelina Jolie looking of late like a female Skeletor, so skinny that her legs look like twigs sticking out of her thick-soled pumps, Olive Oyl-style. And why pop singer Madonna’s arms are strips of sinew, and why reality show celebrities like the Kardashians talk non-stop about what diet works and why yoga is great for keeping a trim waist, and it’s why tabloids publish photo galleries of best and worst beach bodies, and whose cellulite is worse this year than last and why those kinds of cover stories sell by the millions.\nSomehow it’s not character that counts, but calories.\nBut, again, does it matter? Is it anybody’s business? Well, it wouldn’t be, except for the fact that so much has been made of willowy Middleton and her equally willowy sister and maid of honor, Pippa (who recently came in second in a British “Rear of the Year” contest), that one wonders if it isn’t all they think about when they climb out of the shower in the morning.\nIt matters because young people, girls especially, look to princesses and pop singers as their role models, rightly or wrongly. It matters because so many young girls and women today suffer from bulimia and anorexia and a skewed body image that has them binging and purging and eating fewer than 500 calories a day, subsisting not on food but on coffee and cigarettes and diuretics.\nIt matters because, right now, the light of the world is shining on the newly minted duchess. And whether she knows it or not, whether it’s fair or not, whether it’s acceptable or not to pitt her against a ridiculous societal standard, the 29-year-old is by all accounts one of the most-watched and (about to be) most-photographed celebrities on the planet.\nIt matters because she’s a princess, which makes her the modern-day poster girl for wannabe princesses everywhere.\nClick here for more photos of the royal couple at Thursday’s gala.\n", "sentence_count": 30, "List": "1k", "unknown_words": ["abbey", "accompanied", "accounts", "achieving", "anchors", "angelina", "anorexia", "april", "athletic", "attended", "attractive", "banquet", "barack", "barely", "barrage", "beckham", "binging", "british", "buck", "bulimia", "calories", "cambridge", "carriage", "celebrities", "cellulite", "character", "charity", "chic", "cigarettes", "click", "coiffed", "commoners", "constant", "contest", "cookie", "coveted", "crowned", "dashing", "defines", "demands", "designer", "diana", "diet", "disney", "diuretics", "dna", "duchess", "duke", "emotion", "equally", "fairytale", "fashion", "female", "flashbulbs", "gala", "galleries", "gaunt", "groom", "honeymoon", "image", "instance", "jims", "jolie", "kardashians", "kate", "london", "madonna", "maid", "messages", "michelle", "middleton", "minted", "mix", "model", "models", "modern", "monarchist", "moss", "non", "obama", "official", "olive", "opinion", "outing", "oyl", "palace", "pippa", "pitt", "planet", "politicians", "pond", "popular", "poster", "president", "pressure", "pressured", "profile", "prompted", "publish", "pumps", "purging", "radar", "rail", "rear", "regal", "reignited", "ridiculous", "role", "royal", "royalty", "shining", "shower", "shrinking", "sinew", "sis", "skeletor", "skewed", "skinny", "slim", "smartly", "snapshots", "societal", "soled", "spice", "standard", "starving", "strips", "style", "subsisting", "successful", "suffer", "surmise", "tabloids", "thin", "tiara", "trim", "twigs", "u", "understatement", "uniform", "victoria", "waif", "waist", "wannabe", "wardrobe", "wedding", "westminster", "william", "willowy", "wills", "winsome", "yoga"], "simplified": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, known as Kate and Wills, have been in the public eye since their wedding at Westminster Abbey on April 29.

Moderate exercise like walking may be as good as or better than intense workouts when it comes to certain heart health measures, new research suggests.\nNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Moderate exercise like walking may be as good as or better than intense workouts when it comes to certain heart health measures, new research suggests.\nIn a study of 240 overweight, middle-aged adults, researchers found that moderate exercise, but not vigorous activity, improved participants' levels of blood fats called triglycerides.\nMeanwhile, improvements in \"good\" HDL cholesterol seemed to depend on how much study participants exercised, and not how intensely. What's more, researchers found, both benefits were sustained when exercisers took a vacation from working out.\nAll of this is good news for sedentary people who would find it hard to leap from the couch to a daily run, according to the study authors.\nOn the other hand, there's bad news for sedentary people who would prefer to stay that way. In this study, participants who remained inactive saw their \"bad\" LDL cholesterol levels climb over just six months.\nThe negative effects don't stop there. Previous work with the same study group found that inactive participants continued to gain weight and inches around the waistline, lead study author Dr. Cris A. Slentz told Reuters Health.\n\"In overweight or mildly obese sedentary individuals, continuing to be inactive is worse than previously thought,\" said Slentz, an exercise physiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.\nHe and his colleagues report the findings in the Journal of Applied Physiology.\nThe study included 240 overweight, sedentary men and women who were randomly assigned to one of four groups. In two groups, participants worked out intensely on treadmills or other gym equipment, but the amount of exercise varied; one group got the equivalent of 20 miles of jogging per week, while the other logged the equivalent of 12 miles.\nA third group exercised at a moderate intensity for a moderate amount of time -- the equivalent of 12 miles of walking per week. The fourth group remained inactive.\nThe researchers then looked at the effects each regimen had on participants' cholesterol and triglyceride levels over six months -- and whether any improvements were sustained after the exercisers took two weeks off.\nOn average, they found, only the moderate exercisers showed lasting improvements in their triglycerides. Lasting improvements in HDL levels were seen only in exercisers who worked out intensely for a greater amount of time.\nThe same HDL advantage was not seen among people who exercised vigorously for a lesser amount of time per week. So, Slentz explained, he and his colleagues attribute the benefit to the amount of exercise, and not the intensity.\nThe bottom line, according to Slentz, is that \"most all of the benefits\" of exercise are related to the amount, rather than the intensity. An exception is that vigorous exercise, like jogging, is more effective at boosting cardiovascular fitness -- which, Slentz noted, may or may not be important in heart disease risk.\nSo a person's choice of exercise should depend on his or her goals, according to the researchers. For many people, that will mean moderate activity.\nThe \"wonderful thing\" about such exercise, Slentz said, is that people need only find a couple of 15-minute blocks of time each day to take a walk.\nSOURCE: Journal of Applied Physiology, August 2007.\n", "sentence_count": 30, "List": "1k", "unknown_words": ["according", "activity", "adults", "advantage", "applied", "assigned", "attribute", "august", "author", "authors", "average", "benefit", "benefits", "blocks", "boosting", "cardiovascular", "carolina", "cholesterol", "colleagues", "couch", "cris", "disease", "district", "duke", "durham", "effective", "effects", "equipment", "equivalent", "exception", "exercise", "exercised", "exercisers", "february", "gain", "goals", "gym", "harbour", "hdl", "improved", "improvements", "inactive", "inches", "included", "individuals", "intense", "intensely", "intensity", "joggers", "jogging", "journal", "lasting", "ldl", "leap", "logged", "meanwhile", "measures", "medical", "mildly", "moderate", "negative", "obese", "overweight", "p", "participants", "per", "physiologist", "physiology", "prefer", "previous", "previously", "randomly", "regimen", "remained", "research", "researchers", "reuters", "risk", "sedentary", "slentz", "source", "sustained", "sydney", "treadmills", "triglyceride", "triglycerides", "university", "vacation", "varied", "vigorous", "vigorously", "waistline", "waterfront", "workouts", "york"], "simplified": "Moderate exercise, like walking, may be as good or better than intense workouts for certain heart health measures, according to new research.

The study, published in the Journal of Applied Physiology, assigned participants to four groups, with moderate and varied intense exercise routines or inactivity.

There was her own: Franklin produced a bounty of acclaimed books and forged a legacy as one of the country’s most influential authors. And almost 80 years later Judy Davis rose to prominence after starring in director Gillian Armstrong’s fine 1979 adaptation.\nDavis gives a rousing performance as bull-headed protagonist Sybylla Melvyn. The term “once in a lifetime” tends to be slapped around like a bumper sticker, but this meaty role lives up to the accolade. Davis won a Bafta award for her troubles and went on to form a long and distinguished CV.\n“Here is the story of my career. My brilliant career. I make no apologies for being egotistical because I am,” Sybylla intones in her opening narration, with a characteristically smug, holier-than-thou temperament that makes her one of the most memorable characters in Australian cinema. While a sandstorm erupts in the dusty outback around her she writes a diary entry reflecting on her desire to belong to the world of art and literature.\nWith those sun-baked rural locations, it’s obvious from the get-go that My Brilliant Career will be a quintessentially Australian story, set in a quintessentially Australian context. The themes of the film are broad (breaking free of the establishment, being true to yourself) and its message about the virtues and consequences of self-empowerment timeless.\nFrom that opening moment it’s unclear whether Sybylla’s “brilliant career” is wishful thinking or an ambition destined to be realised by the closing credits. Part of the strength and nuance of Armstrong’s film (and the book on which it was based) is that the end result is both – and neither.\nSybylla’s aspirations are realised in the sense that her independence is protected, her integrity maintained and her creative voice given an outlet. But despite those virtues – or perhaps because of them – the people around her, constituents of an atavistic male-dominated hierarchy, remain unconvinced of her success and deeply sceptical of her intentions.\n“Useless, plain and godless” is how Sybylla’s mother describes her early in the film, when Armstrong is still doing the heavy lifting to establish her protagonist as a maligned free spirit rubbing up against the established order of things. In the next scene Sybylla talks to her sister, below the stars, and asks her if she’s dreamed of a better life – of adventure, books and culture, things beyond a farm-girl existence that oscillates between two modes: work and sleep.\nA young woman dreaming of something greater than provincial life is a familiar narrative trajectory, but My Brilliant Career is the seminal work; the grandmother of feminist narratives, built around a character whose determination to live independent of societal expectations took place in a time well before the struggle for women’s rights became a movement.\nDespite a touching romantic subplot featuring a dashing Sam Neill as Harry Beecham – one of the rare people who don’t talk down to, patronise or discourage Sybylla – the film doesn’t replace the lonely dignity of its protagonist with rosiness and romance. She ends the film as she began it, writing pensive thoughts into her diary, having refused Beecham’s hand in marriage. The dignity of the film and its subject remains heartbreakingly intact.\nThere’s no wonder My Brilliant Career is cited as a milestone in Australian feminist cinema. It is a powerful rumination on atavistic Australia, sexism and classism, and a sensitive portrait of a woman destined to think outside the box. Sybylla’s artistic aspirations keep the film relevant and broadly accessible. Pressure from people around her comes in many forms, even in something as innocuous as playing piano. She is instructed “play the nice ones”.\nMy Brilliant Career isn’t “a nice one”. Like its protagonist, it is staunchly unconventional.

Davis won an award for her efforts and built a long and impressive career.\n“Here is the story of my career. My successful career. I apologize for being self-centered because I am,” Sybylla says in her opening speech, with a typically proud attitude that makes her one of the most unforgettable characters in Australian film. While a storm arises in the dry land around her, she writes in her diary about her wish to join the world of art and books.  \nWith those sun-heated rural places, it’s clear early on that My Brilliant Career will be a very Australian story, set in a very Australian setting. The ideas of the film are wide (breaking away from the usual, being true to yourself) and its message about the benefits and results of self-empowerment timeless.  \nFrom that opening moment, it’s unsure if Sybylla’s “successful career” is hopeful thinking or a goal coming true by the end.

In the next scene, Sybylla talks to her sister under the stars, asking if she's dreamed of a better life – of travel, books, and culture, things beyond a farm girl's life that shifts between work and sleep.  \nA young woman dreaming of more than rural life is a common story, but My Brilliant Career is the first of its kind; a key feminist story featuring a character determined to live outside society’s rules, well before the fight for women’s rights started.  \nDespite a touching love story involving a charming Sam Neill as Harry Beecham – one of the few who don’t look down on Sybylla – the film doesn’t replace her lonely dignity with happiness and love.

From the start, it's uncertain if Sybylla's \"brilliant career\" is mere wishful thinking or a goal that will be achieved by the end.. Armstrong's film and the book it's based on are powerful and nuanced because the end result is both things and neither.. Sybylla achieves her dreams by safeguarding her independence, maintaining her integrity, and having a platform for her creativity.. Despite her virtues, the male-dominated hierarchy remains unconvinced of her success and sceptical of her intentions.. Sybylla's mother calls her \"useless, plain and godless\" early in the film, as Armstrong highlights Sybylla as a misunderstood free spirit challenging the status quo.. In the next scene, Sybylla asks her sister under the stars if she dreams of a better life, filled with adventure, books, and culture, beyond their farm-girl routine of work and sleep.. A young woman dreaming of a life beyond her provincial existence is a common story, but My Brilliant Career is the seminal feminist narrative, featuring a character determined to defy societal expectations before the women's rights movement began.. Although the film includes a touching romantic subplot with Sam Neill as Harry Beecham—one of the few who treats Sybylla with respect—it maintains the protagonist's lonely dignity instead of resorting to romance.. She finishes the film as she started, writing thoughtful entries in her diary after rejecting Beecham's marriage proposal.. The film and its subject maintain their heartbreaking dignity.. It’s no surprise My Brilliant Career is considered a milestone in Australian feminist cinema.. It's a strong reflection on traditional Australia, sexism, and classism, and a thoughtful portrayal of a woman who is destined to be unconventional.. Sybylla's artistic goals make the film relatable and widely appealing.. Pressure from those around her appears in many forms, even through activities as harmless as playing piano.. She is told to \"play the nice ones.\". My Brilliant Career isn't \"nice.\". It's as unconventional as its protagonist.. The film is a free spirit that has left a lasting impact on Australian cinema.."}

Once the domain of the well-to-do female in her fifties, plastic surgery has become the obsession of the least affluent segment of younger Internet users.\nThe recent tragic death of Stephanie Kuleba, an 18-year-old high school cheerleader who died as a result of complications during a breast augmentation surgery, brought our attention to the pursuit of a more \"ideal\" body amongst teenagers. In fact, search data confirms this phenomenon. One of the most popular sites visited from the search term \"plastic surgery\" is the official site of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (www.plasticsurgery.org). Over 25% of visitors to the site (the largest segment) fell within the 18- to 24-year-old demographic  that's up from 19.6% two years ago.\nPlastic surgery has become an American obsession. Checking other markets that Hitwise has data on, such as the U.K. and Australia, the 18- to 24-year-old fascination with plastic surgery is a decidedly U.S. phenomenon.\nLooking at other health related sites visited by 18- t 24-year-olds, reveals just how obsessed this age group is with appearance. Unlike their older counterparts who visit sites related to diseases and keeping healthy, younger Internet users flock to sites that dwell on personal appearance, such as those focused on bodybuilding, weight loss and skincare. And definitely plastic surgery.\nWhile surgery-themed television may be driving the interest of a younger audience, one factor appears to be key in tempering appearance-obsessed teens from altering their bodies: the failing U.S. economy.\nIf we track the trend in searches on topics such as \"breast augmentation,\" \"breast implants\" or even \"plastic surgery,\" there has been a precipitous decline in all plastic surgery topics over the last year. What's fueling this downturn? It may very well be related to the predominant income group of visitors to cosmetic surgery sites  U.S. households that earn less than $30,000 per year. In fact, if we look at the search patterns around popular surgeries, over the last year the term \"cost\" is the most commonly appearing qualifier. We see more searches such as \"breast implant cost,\" \"plastic surgery cost,\" and \"breast augmentation cost.\" Checking these same terms in April 2007 reveals that cost sensitivity is a recent phenomenon.\nWhile older demographics continue to search for information on procedures such as face-lifts, liposuction or Botox, it's the younger Internet users who in tough economic times are focusing on improving their outer beauty, albeit at a discount price.\nBill Tancer is general manager of global research at Hitwise.\n", "sentence_count": 32, "List": "1k", "unknown_words": ["adults", "affluent", "albeit", "altering", "american", "april", "attention", "audience", "augmentation", "australia", "bodybuilding", "botox", "breast", "cheerleader", "commonly", "complications", "confirms", "cosmetic", "counterparts", "data", "dazeley", "decline", "demographic", "demographics", "discount", "diseases", "domain", "downturn", "dwell", "earn", "economic", "economy", "extreme", "factor", "failing", "fallout", "fascination", "female", "flock", "focused", "focusing", "fueling", "getty", "global", "hitwise", "households", "ideal", "implant", "implants", "improving", "income", "internet", "k", "kuleba", "liposuction", "loss", "makeover", "nip", "obsessed", "obsession", "official", "olds", "org", "patterns", "per", "peter", "phenomenon", "plastic", "plasticsurgery", "popular", "precipitous", "predominant", "primary", "procedures", "pursuit", "qualifier", "research", "result", "reveals", "search", "searches", "segment", "sensitivity", "site", "sites", "skincare", "society", "stephanie", "surgeons", "surgeries", "surgery", "tancer", "teenagers", "teens", "tempering", "themed", "topics", "tough", "tragic", "trend", "tuck", "u", "www"], "simplified": "Internet data indicates that younger adults are now the main audience interested in altering their personal appearance, a trend possibly influenced by TV shows like Nip/Tuck and Dr. 90210.

The company has provided investors a 42% return, including dividends, over the past five years, versus the greater S&P's return of 87%. Compared with its biggest rival, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola's underperformance is more pronounced, as the former has provided investors a 90% return, double the return of Coca-Cola.\nIn the third-quarter conference call, CEO James Quincey identified three broad tenets for growth. However, the last one received the bulk of the attention:\nWe're looking at opportunities in growing premium segments such as adult craft beverages. As you know, more consumers, most notably adults, are seeking unique and distinct products with sophisticated flavors, quality ingredients, and smaller-scale craft production.\nLater, and after considerable media interest, Quincey walked back his comments by saying although he'd \"never say never,\" he feels moving into alcohol doesn't make sense now. However, often the best solution is one already in front of you: Coca-Cola should lay off the booze and fully acquire Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST).\nAcquisitions have been key for Pepsi and Coca-Cola\nWhile Pepsi's outperformance is recent, the roots of the company's strategy are more than 50 years old. In 1965, PepsiCo was formed through a merger of the Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay companies. Since then, the company has operated as a food and drink conglomerate, buying beverages such as Tropicana, SoBe Beverages, and IZZE Beverage Company for growth and diversification. Recently, while soft-drink sales have slumped because of health concerns, Pepsi's other brands have picked up the slack.\nCoca-Cola has continued to focus on beverages, only recently turning to acquisitions to grow its bottom line. In 2015, the company took a 16.7% stake in Monster and added a strategic partnership to expand Monster's global capabilities.\nSince Coca-Cola accounts for Monster under the equity-accounting method, it's easy to see just how profitable its stake in Monster has been. In the company's recent earnings report, Coke reported the fair value of its investment in Monster Beverage Corporation to be $5.6 billion. Meanwhile, the carrying value -- the price paid, plus earnings, minus dividends -- is $3.4 billion. In the event Coke sold Monster shares today, it would have a pre-tax gain of $2.3 billion, or 68%.\nListen to yourself\nWhile the alcohol comment received more attention from the press, more telling was Quincey's other two prescripts for growth. The first was to identify and incubate high-growth brands; the second was to nurture and expand small brands internationally, whether in-house or by partnerships. While Monster may not technically qualify as a small brand, given its $34 billion market cap, it's due to the company's tremendous growth.\nIn the quarter ended Sept. 30, Monster reported year-on-year revenue growth of 15.4%, bolstered by a whopping 36% international growth. In the corresponding conference call, Monster CEO Rodney Sacks noted (emphasis mine):\nWe continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally.\nCoca-Cola already has a way to increase growth through an acquisition, and it doesn't require buying new, unknown companies or entering into new markets potentially outside its circle of competence. To consolidate Monster onto its financial statements requires a \"control stake,\" often considered 50% or greater.

Instead, Coca-Cola might benefit from fully acquiring Monster Beverage, in which it already holds a significant stake. Pepsi has grown through strategic acquisitions since 1965, diversifying its offerings amidst declining soft-drink sales. Coca-Cola's stake in Monster, valued at $5.6 billion, has been highly profitable, with a potential pre-tax gain of $2.3 billion if sold. Quincey's other growth strategies include nurturing high-growth and small brands internationally, aligning with Monster's 15.4% revenue growth and 36% international expansion.

{"cluster": 6, "text": "Implanted lens may improve vision without eyeglasses in some patients\nSilver Spring, Maryland—(ENEWSPF)—November 22, 2017\nBy: Stephanie Caccomo\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the RxSight Inc. Light Adjustable Lens and Light Delivery Device, the first medical device system that can make small adjustments to the artificial lens’ power after cataract surgery so that the patient will have better vision when not using glasses.\nCataracts are a common eye condition where the natural lens becomes clouded, impairing a patient’s vision. Following cataract surgery, during which the natural lens of the eye that has become cloudy is removed and replaced with an artificial lens (intraocular lens, or IOL), many patients have some minor residual refractive error requiring use of glasses or contact lenses. Refractive error, which is caused when the artificial lens does not focus properly, causes blurred vision.\n“Until now, refractive errors that are common following cataract surgery could only be corrected with glasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery,” said Malvina Eydelman, M.D., director of the Division of Ophthalmic, and Ear, Nose and Throat at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “This system provides a new option for certain patients that allows the physician to make small adjustments to the implanted lens during several in-office procedures after the initial surgery to improve visual acuity without glasses.”\nThe RxSight IOL is made of a unique material that reacts to UV light, which is delivered by the Light Delivery Device, 17-21 days after surgery. Patients receive three or four light treatments over a period of 1-2 weeks, each lasting about 40-150 seconds, depending upon the amount of adjustment needed.

{"cluster": 59, "text": "At least phone psychics have colorful personalities. The OECD has a new report out that blasts its own economists for having foggy crystal balls with regards to their recent forecasts. The Wall Street Journal reports:\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Tuesday said it underestimated the degree to which economic and banking setbacks in one country would have negative impacts on others, leading it to consistently forecast stronger growth than actually materialized in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. But in the latest analysis of forecasting failures by an international financial institution, the OECD said it didn’t share the International Monetary Fund’s view that misjudging the impact of budget cuts on growth was a crucial error. (Emphasis mine)\nThat last part is crucial because it entirely contradicts the progressive viewpoint. Since the recession happened, liberal economists, most notably Paul Krugman, have blamed nearly all of Europe’s economic problems on an underestimation of the damage caused by austerity, meaning budget cuts. They’ve reduced vastly complex economic systems to a single linear scale: more austerity bad, less austerity good. This is why half of Washington throws a four-alarm temper tantrum over seemingly microscopic budget cuts like sequestration. Only now, the OECD concedes that it didn’t underplay the role of European austerity in the wake of the financial crisis at all, but did underplay other factors, especially weak trade and flimsy banks. Also this:\nLarger forecast errors over 2007-12 have occurred in countries with more stringent pre-crisis labour and product market regulations (Figure 3). In part this may reflect the weight given at the time to pre-crisis evidence that tight regulations could help to cushion economic shocks (Duval 5 et al., 2007), together with insufficient attention being paid to the extent to which tighter regulations could delay necessary reallocations across sectors in the recovery phase. (Emphasis added.)\nIn other words, overregulation may have hampered economic growth. Imagine that!\nOver at the Washington Post, Robert Samuelson analyzes the OECD’s findings and concludes that it’s time to stop treating economists as technocratic soothsayers who can gaze into the data and predict the future. The problem is, there’s an entire cottage industry of pundits—many of whom used to work at the Post under Ezra Klein—who think charts, graphs, and studies can light the way into a great, big, beautiful tomorrow of government-guided prosperity. Naturally, Dean Baker, a progressive economist, yelps at Samuelson’s conclusion: “Yes, well we have to keep Robert Samuelson away from the really big numbers, he might hurt himself.” And they say economists can’t be clever!\nBaker’s only real objection, laid out in a comically unsubstantial blog post, is that Samuelson doesn’t mention the reduction in demand that resulted from the housing bubble collapse. Of course weak demand unquestionably played a role. But the point of the OECD evaluation is that, with regards to Europe, the economic establishment was in total error because it spent too much time on a simplistic demand-side scale (“Austerity!”) and not enough time accounting for other factors.\nThat error was probably inevitable. Economies are far too intricate to be encapsulated into digestible one-size-fits-all solutions. Helen Rittelmeyer recently wrote a brilliant piece for First Things that examined how intellectuals today have abandoned moral arguments in favor of coldly empirical ones. (Her article is pay-walled, but well worth the $1.99.)

The OECD highlighted other overlooked factors, such as weak trade and fragile banks. They also pointed out that overregulation might have slowed economic recovery.\n\nRobert Samuelson, writing for the Washington Post, argued that economists should not be seen as reliable predictors of the future, critiquing those who overly rely on data and graphs for economic forecasts. This prompted a sarcastic response from economist Dean Baker, who disagreed with Samuelson's dismissal of demand reduction's role following the housing bubble collapse. He argued that by focusing too narrowly on demand-side factors like austerity, economists failed to adequately consider other dynamics affecting Europe's economy.\n\nThis misstep illustrates the complexity of economies and the limitations of oversimplified solutions.

These rules were thought to help against economic shocks but weren't reevaluated to allow necessary changes during recovery.\n\nIn other words, too many rules may have slowed growth.\n\nRobert Samuelson at the Washington Post examines the OECD’s findings, arguing that economists shouldn't be seen as predicting the future accurately. There’s a whole group of experts who trust data to guide future prosperity. Progressive economist Dean Baker disagrees, jokingly suggesting Samuelson shouldn’t handle big numbers.

{"cluster": 136, "text": "Researchers at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa have developed innovative techniques that could have profound effects on congenital cervical vertebrae malformation research.\nIn the cover-featured research article of the November issue of Molecular Reproduction and Development, researchers looked into congenital cervical vertebrae malformation in humans that can cause neural problems and increase susceptibility to stillbirth in women. Research advancement on abnormal vertebrae development has been limited due to the lack of lab animals with taxonomic equivalency to humans (animal models), and restrictions on human subject research.\nLeading the research effort was Dr. Jinzeng Yang, a molecular biologist in the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources’ Department of Human Nutrition, Food and Animal Sciences. Researchers from Yang’s laboratory have developed a new mouse model that reveals how patterning and developmental proteins can influence cervical vertebrae formation.\nThe mouse model uses a gene suppression technique that induces skeletal formation. The mice and their offspring appear normal but have striking cervical vertebrae formation. Yang’s new gene suppression technique offers benefits, in this case, over the mouse model generated by complete gene removal (knockout mice), which cause mice to die shortly after birth.\nYang’s laboratory has been studying myostatin, a protein playing a dominant role in reducing muscle mass. By genetically blocking the function of myostatin by its partial DNA sequences, mice were developed with 40 percent more muscle mass. Yang’s graduate student Zicong Li, the first author of the publication, hypothesized that this gene suppression strategy would also work to stimulate skeletal development by inhibiting growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), a similar protein to myostatin, and produce live animals. Previously, the mice with complete removal of the GDF11 gene or knockout mice died shortly after birth. In collaboration with Dr. Stefan Moisyadi’s laboratory in the UH Institute of Biogenesis Research, they generated the transgenic mice by using a new single plasmid system of piggyBac transgene delivery, which offers greater transposition rates and precision.\nThe original research article is titled, “Transgenic Over-Expression of Growth Differentiation Factor 11 Propeptide in Skeleton Results in Transformation of the Seventh Cervical Vertebra into a Thoracic Vertebra.” The publication is available online at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrd.21252/full.\nWork was supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Institutes of Health.\nThe College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR), established in 1907 as the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, is the founding college of the University of Hawai‘i.

These cars make up a huge chunk of every automaker's annual sales. But there are really two parts of the mid-size sedan market — the low-priced bargain leaders, and the more powerful and luxurious models at the top of the range.\nYou can buy a Ford Fusion for as little as $21,245, and you'll get a nice car for that money. But if you're willing and able to climb the price and trim ladder to the Ford Fusion Sport at $32,730, you'll find a truly special car waiting for you. The 2017 Fusion Sport can easily compete with the more expensive European and Asian brands on performance, build quality, tech and comfort.\nThe Fusion sport gets a 2.7-liter turbocharged V6 engine rated at 325 horsepower and 380 pound-feet of torque. Power is delivered to all four wheels through a crisp 6-speed automatic transmission.

{"cluster": 106, "text": "Naval Wives & Mistresses\nby Margarette Lincoln\n218pp, National Maritime Museum, £20\nThe god of British naval history, NAM Rodger, once wrote that the social history of the Georgian service would remain incomplete until somebody researched its wives, mothers, sweethearts, trollops and other females left ashore. The wooden warship world is easy to animate; you can pursue the technicalities (all the crafts of ship construction and operation), the hierarchies (exactly how far below the salt was a sailing master?), the strategy, tactics and grog rations through the archives, and compose logbook poetry: \"HMS . . . 28 guns, 197 souls, N coast Brazil.\" But where's the material to raise the women from the deep? Margarette Lincoln, deputy director of the National Maritime Museum, wants to perform this necromancy while subscribing to male rules about facts (sums of money are evidence, court proceedings reliable, statistics sound), and has clearly worked hard to find the stuff.\nTrue, the upper strata of society and the service were habitual letter-writers in the period of her book, the mid 18th century to the end of the Napoleonic wars; although what survives tends to be incomplete correspondence, a single voice of a duet and not always private, since the gold-braided classes jostled in social networking. Lady Amelia Calder, wife to a rear admiral, fluttered at the Admiralty: \"I do desire that you will not be such Savages tomorrow as you have been hitherto, and let us have proper letters by Tuesday's Post.\" How Lady Elizabeth Collins badgered for her son's advancement can be deduced from the First Lord of the Admiralty's reply: \"Madam, It would be very gratifying to me if I had the power to comply with the innumerable applications that are made to me for promotion, and particularly so with your Ladyships . . .\" It wasn't that the spouses of the grandest had little to do but chivvy for glory, since many had to manage estates while their husbands were on the far side of the world and the furthest end of a fouled chain of mail deliveries for years at a time. Admiral Codrington dispatched what sound like Post-it notes to his wife instructing her when to paint the garret floors; Mrs Admiral Boscawen filed business reports to her husband (her barley was the best in the parish) and remembered to send a framed print of him to the Corporation of Truro. This was the Penelope side of being \"a hero's wife\", interrupted on no notice when she had to set out in a chaise in hope of a short port rendezvous. Often enough, the beloved had already heaved off with the tide and the hamper of tender provisions never reached him.\nBut aside from Admiral Rodney, whose financial worries were legendary, status and money were not the nagging concern in the highest echelons that they were among the middling sort, for whom going to sea as an officer in this period was one of the few possible fast tracks not just to income but prize money, everything that Sir Walter Elliot sneered at in Persuasion as \"the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their father and grandfathers never dreamt of\". Fictional Captain Wentworth came back from the wars with £25,000 to rescue Anne Elliot and Jane Austen's plot, but nonfictional rewards were less sure; Austen's brother Charles didn't do that well from prizes and he shipped his family aboard to live economically, which likely caused the death of his wife after childbirth. Finance niggles through the middling stories, the prospect of reduction to half-pay come peace or illness; even in fighting-fit years, a man's shipboard expenses could absorb so much income that a couple might not be able to afford to meet or to pay postage. William Wilkinson, ship's master, told his Sally that everything he owned was hers, and sold his flute for two and a half guineas to settle their bills until the Copenhagen prize money should be paid out.\nLike most of the narratives Lincoln has retrieved, the Wilkinsons' story stops abruptly after this pinched patch, possibly because no more was available, or because Lincoln's technique is to set out her theses - strain of separation, fears of shipwreck - then add a sample human example to substantiate them. The lower the deck, the briefer the entry - Elenor Broderick, a boatswain's widow, asked her husband's former captain to petition a charity, for she and her children were \"in the midst of the greatest distress and Poverty that ever was Experienced\". That's it. Below Elenor there wasn't literacy to scrawl a trace, and Lincoln must do what she can with legal records of women executed for fraudulent claims for navy pay or the murder of a bastard before its non-dad came ashore. The poor whores leave hardly a mark behind, except in songs and prints.\nLincoln prefers to keep her scholarly speculation abstract (women as consumers, gender expectations and so on), but these lives can only be grasped through the texture and tone of days. They left echoes rather than records. Sweet Poll of Plymouth, shown in a 1790 print as drunk, plumptious and supported by affable Devon matelots, was familiar round Stonehouse and Devonport in my childhood: her billowy descendants cruised Union Street pubs in seagreen eyeshadow and fetched up in Beryl Cook paintings. If you were raised in households with dawn calls of \"Rouse up, sleepers awake, show a leg there\", among ditty boxes and duffle bags, dockyardies and Plymouth Gin, male relatives whose absences were spaced over long seasons and women relatives with gale-force tempers those men feared, then nothing is needed to bring this world to the surface but a line from a folk song - \"My love it will endure, dear, like a beacon in the squall / Eternal as the oggy man beneath the dockyard wall.\" And if you weren't, Lincoln's \"relationships between the sexes were affected by local, practical circumstances as well as by ideological and cultural precepts\" won't whistle up a wind.\n", "sentence_count": 27, "List": "3k", "unknown_words": ["aboard", "abruptly", "admiral", "admiralty", "affable", "amelia", "animate", "anne", "archives", "ashore", "austen", "badgered", "barley", "bastard", "beacon", "beloved", "beryl", "billowy", "boatswain", "boscawen", "braided", "brazil", "british", "broderick", "calder", "chaise", "charles", "childbirth", "chivvy", "codrington", "collins", "comply", "copenhagen", "deduced", "devon", "devonport", "dispatched", "distress", "ditty", "dockyard", "dockyardies", "duet", "duffle", "echelons", "elenor", "elizabeth", "elliot", "eternal", "eyeshadow", "flute", "fluttered", "fouled", "fraudulent", "gale", "garret", "georgian", "gin", "gratifying", "grog", "guineas", "habitual", "hamper", "heaved", "hierarchies", "hitherto", "hms", "ideological", "innumerable", "jane", "jostled", "lincoln", "literacy", "logbook", "madam", "margarette", "maritime", "matelots", "mid", "midst", "mistresses", "n", "nagging", "nam", "napoleonic", "necromancy", "niggles", "non", "nonfictional", "obscure", "oggy", "penelope", "persuasion", "petition", "pinched", "plumptious", "plymouth", "precepts", "rations", "rendezvous", "retrieved", "rodger", "rodney", "rouse", "sally", "savages", "scrawl", "seagreen", "shipboard", "shipwreck", "sneered", "spouses", "squall", "stonehouse", "strata", "subscribing", "substantiate", "sweethearts", "technicalities", "tempers", "texture", "theses", "trollops", "truro", "walter", "warship", "wentworth", "whores", "widow", "wilkinson", "wilkinsons", "william"], "simplified": "Margarette Lincoln's book, *Naval Wives & Mistresses*, explores the neglected social history of women connected to the Georgian naval service. Unlike the well-documented operations and hierarchies of wooden warships, the lives of naval wives, mothers, and sweethearts have remained largely unrecorded. Focusing on the mid-18th century to the end of the Napoleonic wars, Lincoln delves into women's roles left ashore as their loved ones sailed. Women of high society often wrote letters and managed estates in their husbands' absence, like Lady Amelia Calder and Lady Elizabeth Collins, who lobbied for their husbands' and sons' advancement. The financial struggles for the middling class were persistent, as naval officers sought swift paths to income through war rewards, though often with mixed results. For instance, while fictional Captain Wentworth returned wealthy, real-life officers like Charles Austen faced financial strain. Stories of lower-deck women, like boatswain's widow Elenor Broderick, were often brief due to a lack of records, leaving Lincoln to rely on legal documents of women executed for crimes like fraudulent navy pay claims. Lincoln keeps her analysis on an abstract level, focusing on gender roles and relationships rather than detailed personal stories. Yet, the echoes of these women's lives are captured in folk songs and cultural legacies that resonate more vividly than scholarly abstractions.", "simplified2": "Naval Wives & Partners  \nby Margarette Lincoln  \n218 pages, National Museum, £20  \n\nThe expert on naval history, NAM Rodger, suggested that studying the lives of wives, mothers, and partners of naval men would complete our understanding of the Georgian navy. The world of wooden ships can be lively and the technical details, ranks, strategies, and provisions are well-documented. But finding sources about the women left behind is challenging. Margarette Lincoln, deputy director of the National Maritime Museum, aims to uncover these stories using facts like money records and court documents.  \n\nIn the 18th century and during the Napoleonic wars, the higher social classes often wrote letters, but many have not survived. Lady Amelia Calder once urged the Navy office for better communication: \"I do desire that you will not be unkind tomorrow and let us have proper letters by Tuesday's Post.\" Lady Elizabeth Collins pushed for her son's promotion. The spouses of top-ranking officers had to handle estates while their partners were away for years. Admiral Codrington sent quick notes to his wife about home repairs, and Mrs. Boscawen managed businesses and sent her husband updates. She even sent his portrait to the city of Truro. Often, these women had to rush to meet their partners in port, only to find them already at sea.  \n\nWhile top officers like Admiral Rodney had famous financial problems, the middle-class officers saw sea service as a rare chance for wealth and status. Fictional Captain Wentworth returned from the wars wealthy, but Jane Austen's brother Charles did not gain much from prizes, leading to hardships. Financial concerns were significant for middle-class families, as peace or illness could cut income, and meeting or mailing became unaffordable. Ship's master William Wilkinson told his partner Sally that everything he owned was hers, selling his belongings, like a flute, to cover costs until prize money arrived.  \n\nLincoln's technique includes showing examples like the Wilkinson's financial issues and others facing longer separations or shipwreck fears. Lower-ranked families are less recorded, except for moments like Elenor Broderick, a widow's, plea for charity due to poverty. Sadly, poorer women left fewer records, except in songs and prints.  \n\nLincoln avoids excessive speculation, instead focusing on evidence she has found. For those familiar with naval life, these stories are brought to life by everyday details. For others, Lincoln’s analysis of gender and social roles may not capture the full atmosphere.", "simplified3": "Naval Wives & Mistresses by Margarette Lincoln, 218 pages, National Maritime Museum, £20: Naval historian N.A.M.

Lady Amelia Calder, wife of a rear admiral, requested the Admiralty to send proper letters by Tuesday's post. Meanwhile, Lady Elizabeth Collins's efforts to secure her son's advancement are evident from the First Lord of the Admiralty's response, expressing his inability to fulfill the many promotion requests, including hers.. The spouses of the grandest had more to do than just seek glory; many managed estates while their husbands were abroad and unreachable for years..

William Wilkinson, ship's master, assured Sally that all he owned was hers, and he sold his flute for two and a half guineas to cover their expenses until they received the Copenhagen prize money.. Like many stories Lincoln collected, the Wilkinsons' tale ends suddenly after a tough moment, possibly due to a lack of information or because Lincoln's method involves presenting her ideas—such as separation anxiety and shipwreck fears—followed by an example to support them.. Elenor Broderick, a boatswain's widow, asked her husband's former captain to request charity aid, as she and her children were in extreme poverty.. That's all.. Elenor couldn't read or write, so Lincoln relied on legal records of women executed for fraudulent navy pay claims or for killing a child before its father returned from sea..

If you grew up in a household with sea shanties, nautical items, and absent male relatives alongside strong-willed women, a folk song line can vividly evoke that world. If not, Lincoln's comment on how local and cultural factors influenced gender relations may not resonate with you.."}

There’s no one here,’” Marshall said with a laugh.\nThe Mustangs, who made back-to-back Vanier Cup appearances, winning 39-17 over the Laval Rouge et Or in Hamilton in 2017 and falling 34-20 to Laval in November in Quebec City, are also losing special teams coordinator and linebackers coach Adrian Kaiser and defensive backs coach PJ Edgeworth.\nMarshall is interviewing candidates and he is confident he will find the right people to fill the coaching vacancies, although he is not planning to make any hasty decisions.\n“You have to look it as an opportunity,” he said. “It’s tough losing those coaches because they are good friends and good people, but at the same time it’s an opportunity for us to find someone else that’s young and wants to come in and work hard and learn what we do here.”\nMarshall is proud of all the coaches who are moving on and he said they will be difficult to replace.\n“That’s what we do at university right?” he said. “For our players this is a place where . . . they go to school and they learn all of the good things about football and teamwork and then they move on and they become doctors like Nick Vanin, or lawyers or pro football players. This isn’t a destination.”\nMarshall is not looking for coaches with specific specialties as much as he is looking for the best people to plug into roles he feels they will be most effective within the Mustangs system.\n“I know that coach (Paul) Gleason is here and he can do the defence and I know that I can do the offence,” Marshall said. “So, if the right offensive coordinator is available, as it was two years ago with coach (Steve) Snyder, who was willing to come in and learn our offence, then I would absolutely consider it, but I’m not just going to bring anyone in.

{"cluster": 137, "text": "Flint Mobile, a mobile payments startup that, unlike Square or PayPal Here, uses the phone’s camera instead of a dongle to “scan” credit and debit cards, announced this morning an add-on in Series B funding from Verizon Investments, the investing arm of Verizon Communications. This brings Flint’s total Series B raise to date to $8 million.\nThe company had previously announced $6 million in Series B funding led by Digicel Group with SVG Partners, Storm Ventures, and True Ventures also participating. In 2012, it had raised $3 million, also from Storm and True Ventures.\nThe Verizon investment is interesting, given that Flint already saw funding from Digicel, a wireless service provider with networks across the Caribbean and the South Pacific. Though the company isn’t discussing its roadmap in detail, it would say that the additional funding from Verizon will help with continued product development and customer acquisition.\n“Mobile operators seem to appreciate our unique focus to offer full mobility for businesses and are interested in pure digital app models to drive innovation and scale,” says Greg Goldfarb, co-founder and CEO of Flint Mobile. “Based on their day-in, day-out business operations, they see the distribution and adoption challenges posed by hardware accessories first hand,” he adds.\nLike its dongle-based competition, Flint’s mobile payments application for both iOS and Android, is designed for use by merchants and other businesses that operate out of the traditional retail environment, but still need a way to process credit and debit card transactions, handle invoices, send out customer receipts and more. The company now goes a step further, allowing its business users to access cash and checks, too, in the latest release, also out today.\nThe update, arriving first for iOS users, allows merchants to send invoices to customers who can then pay online, from their mobile or tablet computer, without waiting for a check or bank transfer. Flint can also track overdue invoices, and send reminders.\nAnother new feature involves Apple’s Passbook. Flint merchants can now create customized coupons within the app or merchant portal, which can be emailed to customers who then add the coupons to Passbook. The feature is available at no extra charge. Merchants can later scan their Passbook coupons to redeem. Those customers without Passbook can instead redeem their coupons via a QR code received via email. And merchants can send out reminders to their customer base via email before coupons are set to expire.\nFlint has been updated to handle multiple items, custom payment amounts, and the application of discounts to transactions, too.\nAndroid users currently can take advantage of the invoicing option through the merchant portal online, but the other new features will arrive on the Android mobile platform in the near future, the company says.\nThe service is competitive on fees when compared with the competition. For example, while Square charges a reasonable 2.75 percent per swipe and PayPal Here is 2.7 percent, Flint reduces that to 1.95 percent for Visa and MasterCard debit transactions, then increases it to 2.95 percent for credit cards. However, the company doesn’t currently support AmEx and Discover, while others do.\nIn addition to its lower debit-card fees, Flint has aimed to differentiate itself by offering other features like its social marketing tools, which allow businesses to generate Facebook referrals via its emailed receipts where customers are invited to leave a review and like a Facebook page.\nThe company today has seen around 200,000 customer installs to date, the majority of which are on iOS, as Android was released just this October. That’s up from the 150,000 installs announced around the same time. Since Q1 2013, transaction volume has growth by 14x or more, according to Goldfarb, and the average transaction amount has consistently been around $100, which reflects its service-oriented merchant user base.\nCustomers on Flint tend to include beauty and fitness services, specialty contractors, photography and local media, healthcare services, pro services (consultants, attorneys, accountants, I.T. services), recreation and tour guides, and direct sales (Mary Kay, Scentsy, etc.) – businesses which are drawn to Flint, says Goldfarb, because there’s no need to acquire hardware in order to get started accepting transactions.\n", "sentence_count": 35, "List": "3k", "unknown_words": ["accessories", "accountants", "amex", "android", "app", "attorneys", "b", "caribbean", "ceo", "coupons", "customized", "debit", "differentiate", "digicel", "dongle", "expire", "facebook", "flint", "goldfarb", "greg", "hardware", "healthcare", "invoices", "invoicing", "ios", "kay", "mary", "mastercard", "merchant", "merchants", "online", "overdue", "pacific", "passbook", "paypal", "portal", "qr", "receipts", "recreation", "redeem", "roadmap", "scentsy", "startup", "svg", "swipe", "tablet", "verizon", "visa", "wireless"], "simplified": "Flint Mobile, a mobile payments startup, uses a phone's camera to scan credit and debit cards instead of a dongle like Square or PayPal Here.

The Council on American Heritage warns that Asaba, now a persona non grata in America, is extremely dangerous.\nBut Ken Asaba doesn't exist. He's a fictional character, voiced by LOST's Harold Perrineau, at the center of America 2049, a trans-media, online game in the middle of a 12-week run. Developed by global human rights organization Breakthrough, America 2049 challenges players on social justice issues from sex trafficking, immigraiton, abortion, and racial discriminiation, all through the lens of a dystopian vision of jingoistic, Orwellian United States. Fascinated by the concept of running human rights game based on a sprawling, mutli-platform gaming experience, America 2049's innovative blend of political drama and civic education attracted Hollywood types like Perrineau, Cherry Jones of 24, and Anthony Rapp of Rent to lend their visages to the project\n\"I try to be a bell ringer about peace and human rights, and I was really fascinated by the idea of an online game,\" says Perrineau, outlining his involvement in the project. \"The first year that I did LOST, JJ Abrams and Bryan Burk were really into gaming. They'd have me come over and they'd play these games for hours. I never really played games, but coming around I wondered how great would it be to be part of some massive, incredibly engaging game. I was fascinated with it at that point, and when Breakthrough told me that America 2049 would be a cross media, online game, the whole format sounded really interesting.\"\nAmerica 2049 is the first of its kind for a social justice game, an immersive online environment designed to utilize Facebook's dynamic network to bring users into a conversation about human rights.\n\"Breakthrough's mission is to find creative ways to tell stories about democracy and diversity and build bridges across constituencies, and identities,\" says Mallika Dutt, President and CEO of Breakthrough and longtime human rights activist. \"Media, arts and culture have been very important tools for us to engage people in constructive dialogue.\"\nFollowing in the footsteps earlier Breakthrough interactive campaigns ICED and Homeland Guantanamos, America 2049 drops the participants into the streets of Portland as an agent of the Council on American Heritage, navigating in a bleak future where the civil liberties we take for granted are distorted or non-existent. Through a series of challenges and puzzles in the hunt for Asaba, players are presented pieces of America's tumultuous history with civil liberties: a 1923 inspection card certifying that immigrants were vaccinated and disease-free, a poster protesting a ban on HIV-positive travelers lifted in 2010, and so on.\nDutt and Breakthrough multimedia director Heidi Boisvert were looking to engage players in a conversation about current tropes of social injustice in our contemporary society through the lens of a deeply immersive game.\n\"I think that games are an amazing oppurtunity to create microcosms of our social and political climate, think differently about problems, try on different identities, work collectively to problem solve, and enrich creative thinking,\" says Boisvert. \"People think of GTA [Grand Theft Auto] and other gaming environments as violent and sexist, but using the same mechanics we can encourage people to think and act differently in the public sphere. Gaming can be a space for trying on new behaviors. But Breakthrough never creates cultural tools. The game in and off itself is not supposed to transform hearts and minds, but there's always a curriculum, a call to take action. We create a virtual environment that extends to material cultural institutions, so the game is promontory.\"\n\"When we talk about human rights and social justice issues, there's a tendency for communities to have conversation within communities,\" added Dutt. \"It's important for us to engage a wider and more diverse audience. What is our country? What will our future look like? What will our nation look like moving forward into that future? Gaming allows us to bring in these wider, more diverse visions of American society into this conversation.\"\nFacebook, which connects nearly 600 million users around the globe and hosts massive social networking games like FarmVille (boasting more than 62 million users) and monopolizes nearly 68 hours per user per month, seems like the perfect platform to immediately reach a vast pool of potential players. While America 2049's primary gameplay takes place on Facebook, the fictional dystopia is spread over many online wikis and portals, from the Council on American Heritage's website to the Zooglio New Network, an imagined news wiki.\nWith a mere 20,000 active users and sparsely populated community wikis, America 2049 is far from a breakout success on the scale of games likes FarmVille, Mafia Wars, or any number of Facebook's procrastination tools. The gameplay on Facebook often proceeds in fits and starts, and despite the rich and intricate user interface, the political overtones are often heavy-handed, and the absence of civil liberties often seems rivaled by the absence of in-game player collaboration.\nBut despite the online game's few cosmetic shortcomings, the program's offline components -- educational events at cultural institutions -- suggest that the human rights issues raised by America 2049 are capturing the attention of players. An April immigration event at the Angel Island Immigration Station in San Francisco attracted more than 100 participants, while a packed forum on human trafficking at the Hull House in Chicago forced staffers to turn away potential attendees.\n\"We've seen an enormous increase in the number of people coming to our offline events as well as more interest in the themes pulled out through the game,\" says Dutt.\n", "sentence_count": 36, "List": "3k", "unknown_words": ["abrams", "america", "american", "anthony", "asaba", "auto", "bleak", "boasting", "boisvert", "breakout", "breakthrough", "bryan", "burk", "ceo", "certifying", "cherry", "chicago", "civic", "constituencies", "cosmetic", "discriminiation", "distorted", "dutt", "dynamic", "dystopia", "dystopian", "enrich", "facebook", "farmville", "fascinated", "footsteps", "forum", "francisco", "gameplay", "globe", "grata", "gta", "guantanamos", "harold", "heidi", "hiv", "hollywood", "homeland", "hull", "immersive", "immigraiton", "immigration", "innovative", "interface", "intricate", "jingoistic", "jj", "jones", "ken", "lens", "longtime", "mafia", "mallika", "microcosms", "monopolizes", "multimedia", "mutli", "namibian", "navigating", "non", "offline", "online", "oppurtunity", "oregon", "orwellian", "overtones", "perrineau", "persona", "plague", "portals", "portland", "poster", "procrastination", "promontory", "quarantine", "rapp", "ringer", "rivaled", "san", "shortcomings", "sparsely", "sphere", "sprawling", "terrified", "theft", "trafficking", "trans", "tropes", "tumultuous", "ugandan", "utilize", "vaccinated", "visages", "website", "wiki", "wikis", "zooglio"], "simplified": "In April, a fictional Ugandan national named Ken Asaba escaped from a quarantine facility in Portland, Oregon, as part of the storyline for America 2049, a trans-media online game produced by Breakthrough, a global human rights organization.

This retrospective analysis showed a significantly greater improvement in depression symptoms in a shorter period of time, when patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were started on combination therapy. The retrospective study compared patients taking L-methylfolate with either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) versus patients who were only prescribed an SSRI or SNRI.\n\"We know from studies that nearly 70% of depressed individuals will not reach remission by taking one antidepressant alone, so clearly a new approach is needed,\" explained the study's principal investigator, Lawrence D. Ginsberg, M.D. of Red Oak Psychiatry, Houston, Texas. \"Adding L-methylfolate to an antidepressant at the start of treatment has valuable benefits for these patients.\"\nThe study demonstrated that:\n-- 2.5 times more patients achieved major improvements in their depressive symptoms, functionality and behavior on combination therapy than on antidepressant monotherapy.\n-- Patients on combination therapy experienced 23% more rapid improvement than those taking antidepressant monotherapy (p=0.03). The more rapid time to major improvement demonstrated in the combination group was sustained throughout the study period (approximately two years).\n-- By 60 days, patients on combination therapy had already experienced a significant improvement (p=0.011) in their CGI scores compared to those on antidepressant monotherapy.\n-- Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were significantly lower in the combination group (17.9%) versus the antidepressant monotherapy group (34%) (p=0.0078), even though the overall rates of adverse events in both groups were not statistically different.\nThe primary outcome measure used in the study was a two point decline in the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score, a seven point scale developed by the National Institute of Mental Health. The CGI-S score is a clinician-determined measure that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the patient's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient's ability to function.\n\"We found that starting patients with a combination of L-methylfolate and an antidepressant was a much more time-efficient approach to help patients get better,\" explained Dr. Ginsberg. \"Even with an aggressive endpoint, looking for a clinically relevant reduction in symptoms, we found that not only did patients on combination therapy experience a significant improvement in symptom severity but they were able to get better faster and with sustained improvement.\"\nAbout the Study\nResearchers performed a retrospective two-arm chart review of 242 adults, ages 18-70, with a primary diagnosis of MDD (single or recurrent), a CGI-S score of four (moderately ill) or five (markedly ill) and were experiencing some degree of functional impairment. Charts of eligible patients were divided into a combination group (SSRI or SNRI in combination with L-methylfolate 7.5-15 mg at treatment initiation; n=95) or a control arm (SSRI or SNRI monotherapy at treatment onset; n=147). Data were recorded on patient characteristics, including pre-treatment versus treatment scores using the CGI-S scale.\nAbout Deplin®\nDeplin is a prescription medical food for the dietary management of suboptimal L-methylfolate levels in patients with depression. Up to 70 percent of people who suffer from depression may have a specific genetic factor that compromises their ability to convert folic acid into L-methylfolate. L-methylfolate is the only form of folate that can cross the blood brain barrier and regulate serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, the neurotransmitters associated with mood.\nAbout Pamlab\nFounded in 1957, Pamlab is a fully integrated pharmaceutical company, with approximately 300 employees, specializing in prescription medical foods. Pamlab's products are marketed and sold nationally, helping hundreds of thousands of patients with depression, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, dementia, high-risk pregnancy and other diseases and conditions.\nAbout Depression\nEach year, nearly 10 percent of the population, or more than 20 million American adults, will struggle with depressive illness.

{"cluster": 102, "text": "WHEN President Hu Jintao of China visits Washington this week, many Americans will clamor for Beijing to stop manipulating its currency. We think we are being cheated on a huge scale, but we should reconsider. When it comes to lost jobs, the negative impact of China’s currency, the renminbi, is less than one might think. Adjusting the exchange rate should not take priority over more vexing issues like North Korea, Iran and bilateral trade.\nSince China agreed to a more flexible exchange rate last summer, its currency has appreciated a measly 3.6 percent against the dollar. This is because China, just like the United States, is also worried about jobs. In going slowly on appreciation, China is giving its exporters time to adjust, thereby limiting job losses and containing social unrest.\nMany Americans believe that the Chinese jobs being preserved by an artificially low currency come at the expense of American jobs. There are three common explanations behind this theory.\nFirst, a stronger currency would increase the purchasing power of Chinese consumers and decrease the relative cost of American goods in China, spurring more Chinese to buy more American products. Second, a stronger currency increases the relative cost of Chinese goods in third markets, like Europe or Latin America. So if the renminbi appreciates, consumers in other countries will shy away from Chinese products in favor of American products. Third, a stronger currency would increase labor costs in China, making it less attractive for American companies to move jobs to China and thus keeping more people employed at home.\nThese claims, however, are more wishful thinking than actual truths. Consider the first idea, that a strengthened Chinese currency would increase the growth rate of American exports to China. From 2005 to 2008, the renminbi appreciated nearly 20 percent against the dollar. Yet, American exports to China over those three years grew at a slightly slower pace than in the previous three-year period when the renminbi did not appreciate at all (71 percent versus 89 percent).\nThis is because many of America’s top exports to China are for capital-intensive goods like aerospace and power-generation equipment. Price is but one of several factors for these purchases, along with technology, quality and service. In addition, American companies in those industries are usually competing against European and Japanese firms rather than Chinese manufacturers. Ultimately, the dollar-euro and dollar-yen exchange rates may play more important roles in Chinese demand for American goods than the renminbi rate.\nSecond, I recently did an analysis of the top American exports to our 20 leading foreign markets, and found little evidence that an undervalued Chinese currency hurts American exports to third countries. This is mostly because there is little head-to-head competition between America and China. In less than 15 percent of top export products — for example, network routers and solar panels — are American and Chinese corporations competing directly against one another. By and large, we are going after entirely different product markets; we market things like airplanes and pharmaceuticals while China sells electronics and textiles.\nFinally, it is unlikely that a stronger renminbi would bring many jobs back home. Instead, companies would most likely shift labor-intensive production to Vietnam, Indonesia and other low-wage countries. And in any case many high-skilled jobs will continue to flow overseas, as long as cheaper talent can be found in India and elsewhere. Only in a few industries, like biomedical devices, would a stronger Chinese currency combined with quality issues tempt American companies to keep more manufacturing at home.\nDon’t get me wrong: China’s currency policies have led to unhealthy artificial distortions in the Chinese and world economy. They also fuel currency wars that threaten to undermine the cooperation needed to sustain a global recovery. And while the effect on American workers is far less than imagined, workers in the developing world stand much to gain from a faster renminbi appreciation.\nWe should discuss currency issues with China, but the exchange rate should not be at the top of the bilateral agenda. The issue is best left to the Group of 20, for this is as much the rest of the world’s problem as it is ours. Resolving our economic troubles will depend much more on reinvesting in education, transportation and other government services, basic science and applied research than on forcing China to yield on its currency.\n", "sentence_count": 36, "List": "4k", "unknown_words": ["aerospace", "airplanes", "america", "american", "americans", "beijing", "bilateral", "biomedical", "china", "chinese", "clamor", "euro", "europe", "european", "hu", "india", "indonesia", "iran", "japanese", "jintao", "korea", "latin", "measly", "pharmaceuticals", "renminbi", "routers", "undervalued", "unrest", "vexing", "vietnam", "washington", "wishful", "yen"], "simplified": "When President Hu Jintao of China visits Washington, many Americans will urge China to stop manipulating its currency, the renminbi. Despite the belief that China’s currency manipulation harms American jobs, its impact may be less significant than assumed. Since last summer, China's currency has appreciated only 3.6 percent against the dollar, as China tries to protect its job market and prevent social unrest.\n\nSome Americans argue that a stronger Chinese currency would boost American exports to China, reduce Chinese competitiveness in third markets, and discourage American companies from outsourcing to China. However, these claims might not hold true. When the renminbi appreciated nearly 20 percent from 2005 to 2008, American exports to China grew at a slower rate compared to a period with no currency appreciation. Many American exports to China are capital-intensive goods where price is just one factor among others such as technology and quality, and competition often comes from Europe and Japan, not China.\n\nAn analysis of American exports showed little evidence that a weak Chinese currency harms American exports to other countries, as the two nations seldom compete directly. Even if the renminbi strengthens, jobs are unlikely to return to America, as companies might shift production to other low-wage countries like Vietnam or Indonesia.\n\nWhile China’s currency policies cause global economic distortions and contribute to currency wars, they have a lesser effect on American workers than believed. Resolution should not prioritize the exchange rate but rather focus on reinvesting in education, transportation, and research. The currency issue is also a global concern that could be better addressed by the Group of 20 rather than solely through bilateral discussions.", "simplified2": "When the leader of China visits the U.S. this week, many people in the U.S. want China to stop controlling its money value. We feel we are being treated unfairly, but we should think again. The loss of jobs in the U.S. due to China’s money value is not as big as it seems. Fixing the money exchange should not be more important than serious issues like problems in Korea, Iran, and trade between countries.\n\nSince last summer, China’s money has grown 3.6% compared to the U.S. dollar. China, like the U.S., also cares about jobs. By slowly changing its money value, China is helping its sellers adjust, which reduces job loss and social issues.\n\nMany in the U.S. think that jobs saved in China due to their money value affect U.S. jobs. Three main ideas support this thinking. First, a stronger Chinese money would let people in China buy more U.S. goods. Second, it would make Chinese goods more costly in other places, pushing people there to buy U.S. goods. Third, it would raise work costs in China, making the U.S. less likely to move jobs there and keeping more jobs in the U.S.\n\nThese ideas, however, are more hope than truth. Look at the idea that a stronger Chinese money would increase U.S. sales to China. From 2005 to 2008, China’s money grew 20% compared to the U.S. dollar. But U.S. sales to China grew more slowly in those years than in the earlier period when China’s money did not grow at all (71% compared to 89%).\n\nThis is because many of the U.S.’s main sales to China are for large items like airplanes and engines. Cost is just one factor; technology and service also matter. Also, U.S. firms in these areas often compete against ones from outside China. So, the dollar rates with euro and yen might be more important for Chinese buyers than China’s money rate.\n\nSecond, a study of the U.S.’s main goods to top buyers showed little proof that China’s low money value hurts U.S. sales to other areas. There’s little direct competition between the U.S. and China, as each targets different items; the U.S. makes things like airplanes and drugs, while China sells electronics and clothes.\n\nLastly, a stronger Chinese money is unlikely to bring many jobs back to the U.S. Firms would probably move work to other low-cost places. Many high-skilled jobs will still move overseas if cheaper workers are abroad. Only in some areas, like medical devices, would a strong Chinese money with quality matters make U.S. firms keep more production at home.\n\nChina’s money policy has created problems in its and the world economy. They cause money conflicts that hurt global work together. While the effect on U.S. workers is less than thought, workers in other parts of the world could benefit from a faster change in China’s money.\n\nWe should talk about money with China, but it should not be the main topic. The Group of 20 should handle it, as it is a global issue. Fixing our economic issues will rely more on investing in learning, travel, services, science, and research than on pressing China about its money.", "simplified3": "When President Hu Jintao visits Washington this week, many Americans will urge Beijing to stop manipulating its currency.. We suspect large-scale cheating, but we need to reconsider.. China’s currency, the renminbi, has a smaller impact on job losses than expected.. Addressing more pressing issues like North Korea, Iran, and bilateral trade should take priority over adjusting the exchange rate.. Since China adopted a flexible exchange rate last summer, its currency has only risen 3.6% against the dollar.. China, like the United States, is concerned about jobs.. By appreciating its currency slowly, China is allowing its exporters to adjust, thus reducing job losses and preventing social unrest.. Many Americans think China's artificially low currency protects their jobs at the cost of American jobs.. There are three common explanations for this theory.. A stronger Chinese currency would boost Chinese purchasing power and reduce the cost of American goods, encouraging more Chinese purchases of American products.. Second, a stronger currency makes Chinese goods more expensive in markets like Europe or Latin America.. If the renminbi rises in value, foreign consumers will prefer American products over Chinese ones.. A stronger currency in China would raise labor costs, making it less appealing for U.S. companies to relocate jobs there, keeping more jobs in America.. These claims are more wishful thinking than true.. Consider the idea that a stronger Chinese currency would boost U.S. export growth to China.. Between 2005 and 2008, the renminbi rose about 20% against the dollar.. American exports to China grew more slowly over those three years (71%) compared to the previous three-year period (89%) when the renminbi hadn't appreciated.. Many of America’s main exports to China are capital-intensive goods like aerospace and power-generation equipment.. Price is just one of several factors in these purchases, along with technology, quality, and service.. Moreover, American companies in those industries typically compete with European and Japanese firms, not Chinese manufacturers.. The dollar-euro and dollar-yen exchange rates might impact Chinese demand for American goods more than the renminbi rate.. I analyzed the top American exports to our 20 main foreign markets and found little evidence that an undervalued Chinese currency harms American exports to other countries.. This is mainly due to the limited direct competition between America and China.. Less than 15 percent of top exports, like network routers and solar panels, involve direct competition between American and Chinese corporations.. Overall, we target different markets: we sell airplanes and pharmaceuticals, while China sells electronics and textiles.. A stronger renminbi likely won't bring many jobs back home.. Companies would likely move labor-intensive production to low-wage countries like Vietnam and Indonesia.. Many high-skilled jobs will keep moving overseas as long as cheaper talent is available in India and elsewhere.. A stronger Chinese currency and quality issues would only tempt American companies in a few industries, such as biomedical devices, to keep more manufacturing at home.. China's currency policies have caused artificial distortions in the Chinese and global economies.. They also fuel currency wars that risk undermining the cooperation necessary for a global recovery.. Although the impact on American workers is smaller than expected, faster renminbi appreciation greatly benefits workers in the developing world.. Currency issues with China should be discussed, but the exchange rate shouldn't be the main priority.. The Group of 20 should address this issue, as it affects the whole world, not just us.. Solving our economic issues relies more on reinvesting in education, infrastructure, government services, and research than on pressuring China about its currency.."}

He’s about to go from being an assistant D.A. to joining a goliath corporate law firm — all chrome, glass and prestige. To top things off, his new beautiful boss Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike) has demonstrated an interest in taking him under her wing, in more ways than one. What could go wrong?\nOn the eve of his move, he agrees to take on one more case for the D.A.’s office. Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins), who we see spying on his cheating wife and then shooting her in the head, has signed a confession admitting to his crime. It should be an open and shut case, but the hotshot prosecutor with a 97 percent conviction rate soon finds himself mired in a trap set by the sociopathic Crawford.\nA courtroom revelation renders Crawford’s confession inadmissible, and Beachum soon discovers that they cannot find the gun used in the crime. “If you look closely enough,” Crawford says, taunting Beachum, “you can find that everything has a weak spot where it can break, sooner or later.” Unfortunately, Fracture suffers from too many weak spots, so\nIn spite of top-notch stars, Fracture abounds in flaws: The film drags, lacks an original story, and derives its main characters all too obviously from The Silence of the Lambs. In addition, moments that are supposed to be suspenseful — like when Beachum races to the hospital with a court-order to keep Crawford from pulling the plug on his comatose wife — are so badly paced that you forget what’s even going on.\nThe romance between Beachum and his new, seductive boss seems to come out of nowhere, and it doesn’t make sense that someone in as high a position as Nikki would jeopardize her job just to sleep with a new employee, however handsome. The film also stumbles during moments intended as comic relief, since the movie hasn’t done its job in setting the proper tone these moments were meant to disrupt.\nBut the biggest disappointment of Fracture involves what could have been a promising rapport between Gosling and Hopkins. Gosling is one of the few actors who can smirk and act cocky and still have you rooting for him; he plays it off as youthful exuberance. His elastic face is as expressive as a silent film star’s, and he has a magnetism that almost makes his boss’s seduction make sense.\nGosling deserves a better sparring partner than Hopkins, who seems to have simply walked from The Silence of the Lambs set without leaving character. Hopkins’ Hannibal Lecter shtick is getting old. His arsenal of sociopathic tics — the nostril flaring, the reptilian slow-lidded closing of the eyes — isn’t bordering on self-parody; it fully inhabits it.\nAlthough Fracture had promise, you just feel like you’re wandering around in familiar territory, none of it surprising or compelling.\nPhotos copyright 2007 New Line Cinema\n", "sentence_count": 25, "List": "4k", "unknown_words": ["abounds", "anthony", "arsenal", "beachum", "chrome", "cocky", "comatose", "courtroom", "crawford", "elastic", "exuberance", "flaring", "gardner", "goliath", "gosling", "hannibal", "hopkins", "hotshot", "inadmissible", "jeopardize", "lecter", "mired", "nikki", "nostril", "notch", "parody", "pike", "rapport", "reptilian", "rosamund", "ryan", "seduction", "seductive", "shtick", "smirk", "sociopathic", "sparring", "spite", "suspenseful", "taunting", "ted", "tics", "willy"], "simplified": "In \"Fracture,\" Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) is a confident prosecutor poised to join a prestigious corporate law firm.

Today, that story gets more sordid in NBC’s follow-up, which shows that investigators suspected the same Ambassador of targeting minor children Meanwhile, the State Department calls allegations of obstruction and interference “preposterous”:\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\nThe alleged misconduct took place during former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s tenure, according to the documents, which also say those activities may not have been properly looked into. Top state department officials directed investigators to “cease the investigation” into the ambassador’s conduct, according to the memo. A state department spokesperson would not confirm the specific investigations, but told NBC News “the notion that we would not vigorously pursue criminal misconduct in a case, in any case, is preposterous.” Former State Department investigator Aurelia Fedenisn has said that investigators dropped the ball in the case, and that a final report published in March of this year was “watered down,” according to her attorney. “She felt it was important that Congress get this information,” Fedenisn’s lawyer Cary Schulman told NBC News.\nAnd this looks worse than it did yesterday:\nThe ambassador who came under investigation “routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children,” according to documents obtained by NBC News.\nThis ambassador got recalled to Washington for a meeting with Patrick Kennedy, Hillary Clinton’s right-hand man at Foggy Bottom. Instead of getting relieved and investigated, CBS reported yesterday that the man was “permitted to return to his post.” Did Kennedy make that decision? Or did Hillary Clinton?\nChuck Todd reports that Rep. Ed Royce, chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee, plans to open an investigation into this scandal. That should include subpoenas for Kennedy and Clinton, and we can see whether Clinton’s famous rejoinder to Senator Ron Johnson gets deployed again in her defense. It’s going to take a lot of explaining to convince anyone why the US sent a man to represent our nation whose own internal security suspected him of sneaking out to target minor children for sexual exploitation — and why these investigations got obstructed to the point where the IG had to blow the whistle to Congress.\nUpdate: The New York Post names names:\nA State Department whistleblower has accused high-ranking staff of a massive coverup — including keeping a lid on findings that members of then-Secretary Hillary Clinton’s security detail and the Belgian ambassador solicited prostitutes. A chief investigator for the agency’s inspector general wrote a memo outlining eight cases that were derailed by senior officials, including one instance of interference by Clinton’s chief of staff, Cheryl Mills.\nAnd the ambassador? The Post ID’s him as a big Obama bundler:\nA DS agent was called off a case against US Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman over claims that he solicited prostitutes, including minors. “The agent began his investigation and had determined that the ambassador routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children,” says the memo. “The ambassador’s protective detail and the embassy’s surveillance detection team . . . were well aware of the behavior.”\nGutman was a big bundler for Obama in 2008, raising over $500,000 for his campaign and cutting checks for the inaugural.

The PSO board approved the TSPA, instructing the company to get federal cabinet approval as mandated by Rule 5 of the 2004 Public Procurement Authority Rules.. According to Rule 5, if PPRA rules conflict with an international treaty or agreement involving the Federal Government, the treaty or agreement will take precedence.. The Petroleum Division suggested to the ECC that, because the TSPA was finalized under a bilateral government agreement and the companies were state-owned, both the ECC and the cabinet should approve the commercial arrangement between the companies.. The ECC wanted the commerce ministry's opinion on imports and the procurement authority's input on bidding exemptions before making a decision.. Published in Dawn on January 2, 2019."}

Information technology (IT) experts have warned the youth that there should be specific steps to ensure that the process is secure and fully judge the credibility of such sites, offering income and profit while staying at home. An expert from the Ministry of IT, requesting anonymity, explained the myths and realities of online earning to APP. He said, “One click doesn’t bring money rather it requires skilled hard work and patience”. But he regretted that the country’s educated unemployed youth were more prone to the Internet crooks and urged to raise awareness among the exposed segment.\nHe said the temptation usually came from random sites and the unskilled people were more attracted as the required job description was tactfully prepared by the schemers to make them fit for the job. Enticing narrations such as “Gharbethay 50,000 rupay mahana kamaeye, sirf computer ka istehmal jan’na zaroor hai,”some how attract the unemployed youth.\nHe regretted that there was no national institution to create public awareness against such mafia and the vulnerable, particularly the youth, who had been left at the mercy of racketeers.\nHe, however, said one could easily judge the credibility of such sites’ source by checking their status on “alexa.com” and “domaintools.com” that provided complete information of a website.\n“The positive thing is that a fake site does not have security certificate as it is too costly,” he added. Another software engineer Attique ur Rehman, highlighting the different ways of online earning, said, “It is a complex subject as genuine sites do not require mere registration but seek a user’s full information. There are different kinds of online earning, such as online trading, freelancing through ads and affiliating market.” The earning through ads, he claimed, was the most popular way as lot of people in Pakistan were earning considerably via AdSense (in which one can upload ads on his websites or YouTube channels) that also required consistency from a user.\nThe most popular among all was stock exchange’s business, but “expertise is a prerequisite for trading on Internet and there is high risk of losing money before one logs in to an authentic business entity,” he added. Attique warned that without proper knowledge and safety measures, the initiative could financially cost a person.\nThe enticers, he said, would demand to deposit Rs 5,000 to 10,000 as registration fee to start earning but later disappeared and reappeared in some cases with a different name as a new stratagem.\nHighlighting the importance of blogging for educated segment of the society, Attique said, “One can sell his skills, especially, writing skill on Internet to anyone across the world by making his own blog that increases one’s earning with the boost in his ranking.”\nHe said one’s profile was updated keeping in view of his clientele that boosted his ranking. Attique said the skilled unemployed youth could be engaged after some training to earn livelihood through Internet and boost the country’s IT sector.\nHe, however, urged the authorities concerned to introduce short courses and training on online earning like the developed nations where the IT sector was the most revenue generating entity and contributing to their national economies.\n", "sentence_count": 24, "List": "4k", "unknown_words": ["adsense", "alexa", "anonymity", "app", "attique", "blog", "blogging", "clientele", "com", "crooks", "cyber", "domaintools", "enticers", "enticing", "f", "freelancing", "gharbethay", "hai", "istehmal", "ka", "kamaeye", "livelihood", "mafia", "mahana", "na", "online", "p", "pakistan", "peshawar", "prerequisite", "prone", "racketeers", "rehman", "rs", "rupay", "seductive", "sirf", "stratagem", "tactfully", "upload", "ur", "website", "websites", "youtube", "zaroor"], "simplified": "Online advertisements promising easy income may be traps set by cyber-criminals, especially targeting young people, warn IT experts.

The studio announced a tentative DCEU release slate at Comic-Con International in San Diego this summer. Now, another film has been added to the growing list of in-development titles with Warner Bros. tapping a directing duo to shepherd a movie focusing on two of the most famous and beloved DC Comics villains.\nTHR is reporting that the studio is in final negotiations with Crazy, Stupid, Love filmmakers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa to write and direct a movie starring The Joker and Harley Quinn - with Suicide Squad actors Leto and Robbie to reprise their roles as the villains. According to the report, the movie will follow Suicide Squad 2 on the DCEU release slate, but since the sequel to David Ayer's villain team-up has yet to be given a release date - and doesn't have a director attached - it's unclear when this Joker and Harley Quinn movie will actually come about.\nScreen Rant previously reported that Warner Bros. was developing a Harley Quinn and Joker spinoff from Suicide Squad, with the tentative title of Harley Quinn vs The Joker. New information from THR indicates it will be a \"criminal love story\" focused on the titular villains; one source told THR it will be \"an insane and twisted love story. When Harry Met Sally on benzedrine.\" Additionally, THR reports Warner Bros. is fast-tracking Suicide Squad 2 as well as this Joker and Harley Quinn movie, so fans may get to see plenty of Leto's Clown Prince of Crime and Robbie's Maid of Mischief in the coming years.\nIn addition to Suicide Squad 2, both Robbie and Leto will appear in Gotham City Sirens. Previously, Gotham City Sirens was reported to be directed by Ayer, who reconfirmed his involvement last month, and is expected to include Catwoman and Poison Ivy, two infamous Batman villains who are part of the titular team in the Comics. Leto's involvement was only recently confirmed, in a report about the development of a solo Joker origin movie that won't take place in the DCEU. Instead, Warner Bros. is launching a new effort of live-action DC Comics adaptations that will be separate from their main superhero universe.\nBased on news of this Joker and Harley Quinn movie, it seems Warner Bros. is doubling down on popular characters already established within the DCEU movie. The Joker and Harley Quinn film would make four movies featuring the two villains, plus the studio announced Wonder Woman 2 at Comic-Con this summer - with the sequel set to hit theaters in 2019. For those hoping to see other DC Comics characters adapted for the big screen, plenty of standalone features are in the works, and the studio's new venture will pave the way for non-DCEU-related projects as well. In terms of the DCEU's future though, fans may be hoping Warner Bros. clears up some confusion concerning the upcoming slate with official announcements and release dates.\nSource: THR\nBond 25 To Receive Rewrite From Bourne Ultimatum Screenwriter\n", "sentence_count": 24, "List": "4k", "unknown_words": ["ayer", "batman", "beloved", "benzedrine", "bourne", "catwoman", "clown", "david", "dc", "dceu", "diego", "duo", "ficarra", "filmmakers", "glenn", "gotham", "harley", "harry", "infamous", "ivy", "john", "leto", "maid", "mischief", "non", "quinn", "rant", "reconfirmed", "reprise", "requa", "robbie", "sally", "san", "screenwriter", "sequel", "shepherd", "sirens", "slate", "spinoff", "standalone", "superhero", "tentative", "thr", "titular", "tweet", "ultimatum", "upcoming", "villain", "villains", "warner"], "simplified": "Warner Bros. is expanding their DC-based cinematic universe by adding a film focused on popular villains Joker and Harley Quinn, with directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa in final negotiations to write and direct.

{"cluster": 80, "text": "While the rest of America celebrated the holidays by briefly escaping the workload that now, once again, dominates their lives, one unlucky group never got the chance to take a day off.\nI’m not talking about the beleaguered clerks at the Big Box stores that never seem to close, but, instead, those valiant defenders of virtue at the American Family Association (AFA). They were busy trying to stop elves from cavorting with a known lesbian.\nIn December, One Million Moms, the inexplicably angry online village founded by the AFA, inveighed against J.C. Penney for a holiday ad featuring spokeswoman Ellen DeGeneres.\n“JCP has made their choice to offend a huge majority of their customers again,” Moms said in a statement. “Christians must now vote with their wallets.”\nHyperbole is nothing new for the AFA satellite army. When Penney first hired DeGeneres last February, Moms blasted the retailer for “jumping on the pro-gay bandwagon.” Back then, the nasty broadside was wearying, though predictable.\nThis time, it was just stupid. In the holiday spot, DeGeneres talked gift-shopping with a trio of Santa’s elves. Scary, right?\nReasonable people can disregard the ramblings of a belligerent splinter group (as DeGeneres herself noted, you have to wonder about an organization that calls itself One Million Moms but can barely round up 50,000 Facebook followers). But I continue to be bewildered by the obsessive, mean-spirited activism of the American Family Association itself.\nSince its founding in 1977 by a Methodist pastor in Mississippi, the AFA (whose mission is to rid the nation of “ungodliness and depravity”) has sprayed its venomous indignation like buckshot, boycotting any group that bears the faintest whiff of gay inclusion.\nAmong its countless targets: the Walt Disney Co., for promoting “the homosexual agenda” by providing health coverage for employees in same-sex relationships; the American Girl doll company, for supporting the non-profit youth organization Girls Inc., which it called “a pro-abortion, pro-lesbian advocacy group.”\nAFA has also turned its sights on Hallmark, for offering same-sex wedding cards on its racks; the Ford Motor Co., for advertising in gay publications and sponsoring gay pride celebrations; Archie comic books, for allowing its first openly gay character to marry another man in one of its stories; McDonald’s, for joining the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce; and the Campbell Soup Co., for buying an ad in a gay magazine that featured a presumably lesbian couple and their son enjoying a bowl of butternut squash bisque.\nThese people must be exhausted.\nThough the AFA has largely gone after corporations that have the means to fight back, it crossed the line in late 2012 when it chose a new and more defenseless kind of victim: children.\nIn October, National Bullying Prevention Awareness Month, it launched an offensive against Mix it Up at Lunch Day, an 11-year-old national program that encourages kids to seek out new friends in the cafeteria as a way of keeping cliques—and bullying—at bay.\nThe AFA decried the program as “a nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools,” and it asked parents to file protests or keep their children home from school on that day.\nSupporters of AFA’s efforts argued that anti-bullying campaigns focus too heavily on protecting gay and questioning youths at the expense of non-gay bullying victims. But the fact is, numerous studies—including a survey by researchers at Harvard—have determined that gay kids are one to two times more likely to be bullied than straight kids, and between two to four times as likely to attempt suicide. It is a problem within a problem.\nThe AFA boycott was ultimately unsuccessful—only about 200 of the 2,500 participating schools reportedly canceled the day’s events—but it underscored the shameful irony at the heart of the brouhaha: that the American Family Association has now, in effect, become the nation’s reigning bully, preying on those who are different.\nOne would think that the AFA might learn a thing or two from the election season polls, which revealed that most citizens are turned off by negative attacks and, likewise, by those who would pry into their personal lives, including their sexual preferences. One would also think that the AFA might learn a lesson from last month’s tragedy in Newtown, Conn.: that our children are not only precious to us but also frighteningly vulnerable, and undeserving of being anyone’s prey.\nIt’s time to ask the AFA to stand down. Despite its self-appointed, McCarthy-like crusade to transform this nation into its own image, America doesn’t need its help, thank you.\nBruce Kluger contributes to Parenting, The Los Angeles Times, USA Today and National Public Radio.\nRelated Posts\n", "sentence_count": 38, "List": "5k", "unknown_words": ["afa", "america", "american", "angeles", "anti", "archie", "bandwagon", "beleaguered", "belligerent", "bisque", "broadside", "brouhaha", "bruce", "buckshot", "butternut", "c", "cafeteria", "campbell", "cavorting", "christians", "cliques", "conn", "decried", "degeneres", "depravity", "disney", "disregard", "ellen", "facebook", "ford", "hallmark", "harvard", "hyperbole", "indignation", "inexplicably", "inveighed", "j", "jcp", "kluger", "lifestyle", "los", "mccarthy", "mcdonald", "methodist", "mississippi", "newtown", "non", "online", "pastor", "penney", "pry", "ramblings", "santa", "splinter", "spokeswoman", "underscored", "ungodliness", "usa", "valiant", "venomous", "walt", "whiff", "workload"], "simplified": "During the holidays, while most of America took a break, the American Family Association (AFA) remained busy targeting J.C.

DeGeneres discussed gift-shopping with Santa's elves at the holiday spot.. Scary, right? Reasonable people can ignore the rants of a hostile fringe group, especially when it calls itself One Million Moms but only has about 50,000 Facebook followers, as DeGeneres pointed out.. I remain confused by the American Family Association's obsessive, mean-spirited activism.. Founded in 1977 by a Methodist pastor in Mississippi, the AFA aims to eliminate \"ungodliness and depravity\" and boycotts any group that hints at gay inclusion.. The AFA has targeted numerous companies, including Walt Disney for supporting same-sex employee benefits, American Girl for backing Girls Inc., Hallmark for selling same-sex wedding cards, Ford for advertising in gay media and sponsoring pride events, Archie comics for featuring a gay character's marriage, McDonald's for joining the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, and Campbell Soup for an ad depicting a lesbian couple with their son.. They must be tired.. The AFA, usually targeting corporations that can defend themselves, went too far in late 2012 by targeting children.. In October, during National Bullying Prevention Awareness Month, it attacked Mix it Up at Lunch Day, a program that for 11 years has encouraged kids to make new friends in the cafeteria to prevent cliques and bullying.. The AFA criticized the program as promoting \"a homosexual lifestyle in public schools\" nationwide and urged parents to protest or keep their children home that day.. AFA supporters claimed that anti-bullying campaigns overly prioritize gay and questioning youths, neglecting non-gay victims.. Numerous studies, including a Harvard survey, show that gay kids are 1-2 times more likely to be bullied and 2-4 times more likely to attempt suicide than straight kids.. It's a problem within a problem.. The AFA boycott largely failed, with only 200 of the 2,500 schools canceling events, but it highlighted the irony that the American Family Association has become a dominant bully targeting those who are different.. One might expect the AFA to learn from polls that show most citizens dislike negative attacks and intrusions into their personal lives, including their sexual preferences.. The AFA should learn from last month's Newtown tragedy that children are precious, vulnerable, and should never be prey.. It's time to ask the AFA to step aside.. America doesn’t need the help of this self-appointed crusade to change the nation in its image.. Bruce Kluger contributes to Parenting, The Los Angeles Times, USA Today, and NPR..

General Assembly urged nations Wednesday to consider temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling, disappointing scientists and some countries seeking an immediate halt to the destructive fishing practice.\nEnvironmental groups say bottom trawling is killing little-known coral ecosystems and the species that dwell in them, and must be suspended so the remote areas can be studied.\n“I’m disappointed to be honest, because bottom trawling is the world’s most destructive method of fishing and we have documented this beyond a reasonable doubt,” said Elliott Norse, president of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute.\nBottom trawlers rake giant nets equipped with wheels, chains and metal doors across the sea floor to scoop up fish. The contraptions bulldoze everything in their path, shattering corals and churning up huge clouds of sediment that choke any life that escapes.\nSeamounts threatened\nTheir main targets are the teeming deep-sea mountains called seamounts, home to thousands of species of corals and fish, some of which have never been identified. Many of the seamounts are as much as a mile deep on the edge of the continental shelf, outside national waters and thus largely free of national regulation.\nCompare your thoughts with U.S. surveyLike all General Assembly resolutions, the moratorium would not have been legally binding but would have had the weight of international opinion behind it.\nIn February, 1,136 biologists, including Norse, signed a statement urging the United Nations and national governments to ban the practice.\nAmong the leading opponents of a ban were Japan and Iceland. They are two of 11 countries whose fisheries accounted for 95 percent of the high seas bottom trawling catch in 2001, according to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.\nTwo resolutions passed\nThe General Assembly passed two resolutions that skirted a moratorium. The first expressed concern about damage to marine environments and called on states to address destructive fishing practices. That passed 141-1 with two abstentions. Turkey cast the lone vote against.\nGuide lists seafood by abundance and scarcityThe other resolution asks nations to consider an interim ban on bottom trawling. The resolution was passed orally.\nEnvironmental groups say an area twice the size of Europe has already been destroyed by high seas bottom trawling.\n“They can have as many conferences as they want in 2006 to discuss biodiversity and areas beyond national jurisdiction, there just won’t be that much left by the time they finish discussing to actually protect it,” said Karen Sack, oceans policy adviser at Greenpeace International.\n", "sentence_count": 23, "List": "5k", "unknown_words": ["abstentions", "biodiversity", "bulldoze", "churning", "contraptions", "ecosystems", "elliott", "europe", "greenpeace", "iceland", "japan", "karen", "moratorium", "n", "norse", "scarcitythe", "seafood", "seamounts", "skirted", "surveylike", "teeming", "trawlers", "trawling", "turkey", "u"], "simplified": "The U.N.

People in general, as they are at every conference, were far more interested in shmoozing and snagging as much free stuff as possible, getting onto the Wi-Fi and grabbing a power outlet, than they were in the sessions themselves.

{"cluster": 16, "text": "Former mob boss and fugitive James \"Whitey\" Bulger is seen in a booking mug photo released to Reuters on August 1, 2011. REUTERS/U.S. Marshals Service/U.S. Department of Justice/Handout\n(Note: Paragraph 15 contains language that may offend some readers)\nBy Scott Malone\nBOSTON (Reuters) - For six weeks, James “Whitey” Bulger’s trial has played out like a movie. The longtime Boston mob boss has angrily cursed in open court, his own lawyer has described him as a mobster, and a potential witness turned up dead on the side of a road.\nAs prosecutors prepare to wrap up their case in the next few days and hand it over to the defense, the biggest question on observers’ minds is whether the 83-year-old defendant will raise the dramatic ante by taking the witness stand.\nBulger, whose story inspired the 2006 Academy Award-winning film “The Departed,” emerged as one of Boston’s most feared criminals in the 1970s and 80s. He ran a gang that prosecutors allege sold drugs, extorted bookies and murdered competitors, suspected informants and innocent bystanders.\n“There’s a significant likelihood of a fairly out-of-the-box experience, and that is Whitey using the opportunity to testify as his final moment in the sun and a chance for score-settling ... embarrassing old foes and old rivals,” said former federal prosecutor Mark Pearlstein, a partner in the Boston law firm McDermott Will & Emery.\nBulger, who has lost the shock of light-colored hair that earned him the nickname “Whitey” in his youth, has pleaded not guilty to all charges. But for decades, he has been notorious for his reign as head of South Boston’s Winter Hill gang.\nThose years of murder and mayhem have been on display during the trial, as witnesses described how the gang smuggled drugs and firearms, extorted a variety of people from bookies to business owners, and murdered rivals, suspected informants and innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire.\nOn Thursday, police said one of Bulger’s extortion victims, who had hoped to testify at the trial, had turned up dead. The body showed no signs of trauma but authorities are conducting an autopsy and doing toxicology tests.\nDefense attorneys often advise their clients not to take the stand. The risk of alienating the jury or causing jurors to doubt the honesty of the accused is said to outweigh any benefit of the defendant telling his side of the story.\nBut given Bulger’s reputation and after six weeks of testimony from dozens of witnesses ranging from former mob associates to relatives of murder victims, he may feel he has nothing to lose.\nBulger may also want a chance to publicly dispute the accusation that appears to bother him most: that he acted as an FBI informant.\nIn his opening statements, lead defense attorney J.W. Carney described Bulger as an extortionist, drug dealer and loan shark who ran an “unbelievably lucrative criminal enterprise.”\nWhat the defense has not acknowledged, and has spent much of its time trying to discredit, is that Bulger cooperated with the FBI, specifically corrupt agent John Connolly. The former agent is now serving a 40-year prison sentence on murder and racketeering convictions.\nBulger contends he paid Connolly for information but provided none of his own. The mob boss regards talking to the authorities, or being “a rat,” as the worst offense a gang member could commit. Prosecutors contend Bulger murdered several people he believed were talking to the FBI.\nOne of Bulger’s notable outbursts in the trial came when Connolly’s former FBI boss, John Morris, was on the stand describing a cozy relationship between Bulger and the bureau.\n“You’re a fucking liar,” Bulger shouted.\nTrial watchers point to outbursts like that as signs that Bulger believes he has little chance of beating charges that carry the possibility of life in prison.\n“I will be very surprised if ‘Whitey’ Bulger testifies,” said Thomas Peisch, a partner with Boston law firm Conn Kavanaugh and a former state prosecutor. “However, it does not appear that he has anything to lose and his ego may carry the day.”\nBulger fled Boston and eluded capture for 16 years after Connolly tipped him off in 1994 that arrest was imminent. He appeared on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted” list, but many in Boston thought he would never be found. Agents found him in June, 2011, living in a seaside apartment in Santa Monica, California.\nNow that he is back in the spotlight, Bulger may seek a last chance to beef up the myth of a straight-shooting mobster, who lived by a code of rough justice and silence.\n“If he does end up taking the stand, it’s because he knows it’s over and there might be some rough going, but he wants that wrestling match, he wants to shout back at the prosecutors,” said Richard Lehr, author of a book on Bulger titled “Black Mass” and a professor of journalism at Boston University.\n", "sentence_count": 39, "List": "5k", "unknown_words": ["ante", "autopsy", "bookies", "boston", "bulger", "bystanders", "california", "carney", "conn", "connolly", "crossfire", "discredit", "eluded", "emery", "extorted", "extortion", "extortionist", "fbi", "firearms", "foes", "fucking", "fugitive", "handout", "j", "james", "john", "jurors", "kavanaugh", "lehr", "longtime", "lucrative", "malone", "mayhem", "mcdermott", "mobster", "monica", "morris", "outbursts", "outweigh", "pearlstein", "peisch", "racketeering", "reuters", "richard", "santa", "scott", "seaside", "spotlight", "thomas", "toxicology", "u", "w", "whitey"], "simplified": "James \"Whitey\" Bulger's trial has been dramatic, involving courtroom outbursts and unexpected events, like the death of a potential witness.

{"cluster": 48, "text": "A long-awaited State Department environmental assessment found that the Keystone XL pipeline is unlikely to have a “substantial impact” on developing the western Canada tar sands, a conclusion that rejects opponents’ claims that the project would dramatically increase greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe department released the supplemental draft environmental statement evaluating a new route for the pipeline that would skirt an ecologically sensitive region of Nebraska. While the project made no recommendation on how to proceed, it did not signal any significant environmental obstacles to the project, which is designed to transport crude oil from western Canada to Gulf Coast refineries.\nThe department is reviewing the proposal in preparation for making a recommendation to President Barack Obama, who has the final say on whether to approve the project.\nThe finding that the project would not significantly increase emissions that contribute to global warming is a major setback to environmentalists, who had insisted on a “lifecycle” evaluation of the impact on greenhouse gas emissions from extraction until burning.\n“With this preliminary analysis, we find in this draft that the approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, including this proposed project, really remains unlikely to significantly impact the rate of development of the oil sands, or the continued demand for heavy oil in the U.S.,” Kerri-Ann Jones, assistant secretary for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs, told reporters.\nEnvironmentalists expressed outrage at the finding, which Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune described as “deeply flawed.”\n“We’re mystified as to how the State Department can acknowledge the negative effects of the Earth’s dirtiest oil on our climate but at the same time claim that the proposed pipeline will ‘not likely result in significant adverse environmental effects,’ ” Brune said, expressing dismay that an agency headed by Secretary of State John Kerry, who was a leading champion of efforts to stem greenhouse gas emissions when he served in the Senate, could produce the report. “Whether this failure was willful or accidental, this report is nothing short of malpractice.”\nBill McKibben, founder of the grass-roots climate change movement 350.org, said the State Department’s analysis was comparable to what he described as its failure to anticipate the Arab Spring.\nHe called it “really sad” that the concerns of opponents who were committed enough to go to jail in protest, as well as those of leading scientists, were “just blankly dismissed by just a reiteration of the same tired boilerplate.”\nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer said she would review the impact statement closely.\n“I continue to be very concerned about the contribution that the Keystone XL pipeline would make to dangerous climate change,” Boxer said.\nSupporters Heartened\nBut supporters of the project seized on the findings to urge expedited approval of the project.\n“It is time to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which has undergone more than four years of the most exhaustive environmental scrutiny of any pipeline in U.S. history,” said Sen.

But the president invited TransCanada to submit a new application once it had mapped out an alternative route for the pipeline, and the company filed a new application last May rerouting the pipeline around the Sand Hills.\nEnvironmentalists have argued that increasing production of the heavy tar sands oil — which requires far more energy than conventional oil to extract, transport and refine — would dramatically increase carbon pollution. A Congressional Research Service report last May found that building the pipeline could cause an increase in annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to putting 588,000 to 4 million more passenger cars on the road.\nBut the State Department review found that denying the pipeline would not “significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the U.S.” If the project were denied and other pipeline and rail transport projects move forward, the decrease in production of the crude oil from not building Keystone would have little impact on emissions, the study found.\n“Fundamental changes to the world crude oil market” would be needed to “significantly impact the rate of production in the oil sands.”\nThe draft review’s publication in the Federal Register will launch a 45-day comment period, which will include a public meeting in Nebraska, according to the State Department.

A university made a tool that tests kidneys and sends data through a phone.", "simplified3": "Researchers have developed a smartphone device for blood tests, which could enhance life quality for those being treated to prevent blood clots.. Blood clots in arteries and veins can raise the risk of heart attack and stroke.. High-risk individuals for blood clots are often treated with anticoagulants, which thin the blood and prevent clotting.. Anticoagulant therapy needs patients to frequently monitor blood flow in the hospital.. Taking the wrong dosage of anticoagulants can cause cardiovascular problems instead of reducing them.. Researchers from Qloudlab, a start-up at EPFL in Switzerland, have developed a device for patients on anticoagulant therapy to self-monitor.. How does the device work? The gadget is a small disposable film attached to a smartphone screen.. The film is made of a microstructured plastic layer a few micrometers thick.. The creators claim the smartphone device (pictured) could enhance life quality for patients on anticoagulant therapy.. The smartphone device (pictured and credited to Alain Herzog) could enhance life quality for patients on anticoagulant therapy by detecting a blood molecule that starts coagulation when blood enters the film through capillary action.. The phone interprets results by analyzing interferences in the electric field on its screen.. This process is like when your finger touches a smartphone screen.. The results are sent to a Qloudlab smartphone app.. The data can be sent to a doctor to determine if the patient's treatment needs modification.. Arther Queval, founder of Qloudlab, states their test will greatly enhance life quality for patients receiving this treatment. Qloudlab applied for a device patent and received Venture Kick funding to hire a biochemist.. The team aims to prove the device's lab-test reliability by next year and move toward commercialization.. Combining smartphones with self-monitoring is becoming more popular.. Medical News Today reported a smartphone case that measures vital signs like blood pressure, temperature, and blood oxygen.. Last year, UCLA created a portable device for kidney tests that sends data via a smartphone attachment.."}

{"cluster": 77, "text": "This story is as much mine as it is yours; the story of the chosen; rose golden.\nWe entered Stanford disoriented, chasing truth — what is that one particular thing we were born to do? Everyone else had one. We always had some kind of an affinity for technology, but we were no programmers. We had yet to intern for Intel, design for Duolingo or abstract an Android app. Still, tech was our best bet; it’s what we knew best. It wasn’t easy, but we strove to emulate the noble words of our Stancestors: “All it takes is hard work!”\nAfter that, we evacuated tears. Desecrated personal goals. Mangled expectations. Crushed ourselves against deadlines our friends met easily. We contemplated that we lacked the intellectual capabilities required for college-level computer science. Why wasn’t this as easy as it was supposed to be? Unbeknownst to us, we had set ourselves up to fail by comparing ourselves so intimately to others. Every step along our intellectual journey had been marred by sad, sad comparisons to the abounding skills and experiences possessed by our untouchable acquaintances, classmates and friends.\nAll of this changed after Art. We made a few strange decisions in sequence: changing our intended major from Computer Science to Symbolic Systems; ranking high and ultimately moving into Kimball Hall, the arts-themed and transfer student dorm; enrolling in Art History 1B with well-known lecturer Alexander Nemerov. These all became instrumental in our self-development.\nSwitching our intended major before our initial decision had even made its way to official documents felt simple, but we now grappled with taking a burst of humanities classes that would perpetuate the pallor of our already weak computer science skills.\nLiving in Kimball Hall normalized our exposure to some niches that lived their lives in magnitudes of difference from us; fearless singers, bold painters, intimate writers, extemporaneous actors. Leaders, dreamers, creators. In being immersed with this crowd, we were forced to confront and contemplate their respective perspectives on life. They created from their hearts, from their souls, their guts. In this world where finally we could value introspection, the superfluousness of comparing our unique talents to others’ became obvious.\nNow living in Kimball, we sat down for Art History with professor Nemerov. On a superficial level, he looked like a “chill dude.” We had heard a wealth of good things about his skills as a lecturer, and thus we solidified our expectation: we were to be entertained. Instead, we were transformed. Art made up just the smallest portion of our working brain energy until this moment, when we became transfixed by the words Nemerov said and the ways in which he said them.\nNemerov spoke to us in our floor seat from his pedestal on the stage of Cubberley Auditorium, blasting puzzle pieces of knowledge at us. Jigsaw pieces that served not merely to inform us the factual stories behind phenomenal religious imagery and works of art, but also to acquaint ourselves with the thought processes of the greats. We realized that the greatest of the great didn’t let comparisons to others impede them from attaining their sacred personal goals, they simply believed in their thoughts, feelings and abilities of expression. From this, we found our confidence of self-expression and liberated our potential. With this realization came another, that the puzzle pieces Nemerov gave so freely were there for us to piece together our own masterpiece.\nWe have done amazing things in our lifetime, but the masterpiece has yet to come. In the past, mindlessly following the direction of the career expectations set for us by others and ourselves, we probably would have idly expected the arrival of this masterpiece. Now, we choose to forge it.\nI confidently believe, “All it takes is real belief in yourself as a person and hard work.”\nContact Coco Hergenroeder at codyhergenroeder ‘at’ stanford.edu.\n", "sentence_count": 40, "List": "6k", "unknown_words": ["alexander", "android", "app", "auditorium", "classmates", "coco", "codyhergenroeder", "cubberley", "desecrated", "disoriented", "dude", "duolingo", "edu", "extemporaneous", "grappled", "hergenroeder", "intel", "introspection", "jigsaw", "kimball", "lifetime", "mangled", "nemerov", "pallor", "pedestal", "phenomenal", "stancestors", "stanford", "superfluousness", "transfixed", "unbeknownst"], "simplified": "This is both our story and yours, the journey of the chosen. We started at Stanford unsure, seeking our purpose, aware of our interest in technology but lacking programming skills. Despite challenges, we pursued tech, inspired by our predecessors' belief in hard work. We faced struggles, comparing ourselves to others and doubting our abilities. A turning point came when we shifted our major from Computer Science to Symbolic Systems, moved into Kimball Hall, and took Art History with Alexander Nemerov. These decisions were crucial in our growth.\n\nLiving in Kimball exposed us to fearless artists who taught us the value of introspection and diminished our need for comparison. In Art History, Nemerov's lectures transformed us; his insights inspired self-expression and helped us find confidence. We realized great individuals don't compare themselves to others; they believe in their vision. While we’ve accomplished much, our greatest work is still ahead.

We started at a new place, unsure, searching for our purpose. Others seemed to have theirs. We had an interest in technology, but were not programmers.

It was challenging, but we aimed to follow the wise words of those before us: “All it takes is hard work!”\n\nWe faced struggles, missed goals, and felt overwhelmed by deadlines others met easily. We thought we lacked the skills needed for college-level computer science. Why wasn't it easier? We unknowingly set ourselves up for failure by comparing ourselves too closely to others. Our journey was marked by sad comparisons to the skills and experiences of our friends and classmates.\n\nEverything changed after we discovered Art. We made some unusual choices: changing our major from Computer Science to Symbolic Systems; moving into an arts-themed dorm; and enrolling in a class with a well-known lecturer. These choices played a big role in our self-growth.\n\nChanging majors was easy, but we had to adjust to new humanities classes which highlighted our weaker tech skills. Living in the new dorm exposed us to a variety of people—singers, painters, writers, actors—who were fearless and creative. Immersed in this environment, we reconsidered our views. They created from their hearts and spirit. We learned to appreciate self-reflection and stopped comparing our unique talents to others’.\n\nIn our new dorm, we attended Art History with a respected professor. He looked laid-back but was said to be a great teacher. We expected to be entertained, but instead, we were changed. Art had been a minor part of our focus until then, when his words captured our attention.\n\nHis lectures were like pieces of a puzzle, not just teaching us about art, but also about the thinking of great artists. We realized they didn’t let comparisons stop them; they believed in their own ideas and abilities. From this, we found confidence and freed our potential. We understood that the knowledge pieces he shared were for us to build our own masterpiece.\n\nWe've achieved much, but our best work is yet to come.

{"cluster": 25, "text": "While Batman is arguably the world’s most popular superhero, his journey through Hollywood hasn’t always been a smooth one. The Caped Crusader’s first theatrical appearances date back to the 1940s, in the form of serials. His first feature-length adventure was 1966’s Batman: The Movie, an extension of the legendarily campy TV series starring Adam West and Burt Ward. Finally, in 1989, Tim Burton brought Batman to full blockbuster status, creating a stylized Gotham City with a dark, Gothic edge, and a Batman twisted enough to outright kill The Joker.\n1992’s Batman Returns mostly continued this success, and is today remembered nearly as well as its progenitor. Unfortunately, that’s where Joel Schumacher came in, taking over the reins of the Bat-series as director. While 1995’s Batman Forever has its fans, 1997’s Batman & Robin earned widespread derision, taking things to a level of silliness not seen since the West/Ward days, and turning formidable villain Mr. Freeze into a laughingstock.\nThankfully for Bat-fans, then-rising director Christopher Nolan arrived to fix the franchise in 2005, granting Bruce Wayne’s cowled alter-ego the origin story he deserved in the form of Batman Begins. Presenting a more realistic take on Batman’s ascent to arch protector of Gotham, Batman Begins showcased the evolution of Bruce into the hero he would eventually become, and chronicled his training at the hands of Ra’s al Ghul’s League of Shadows. Now, years after covering Nolan’s follow-up efforts The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, Screen Junkies has given Batman Begins the Honest Trailers treatment. Check it out in full above.\nAs was the case when Honest Trailers tackled The Dark Knight, the series’ signature deep-voiced narrator does spend some time admitting that Batman Begins is a pretty damn good film. Still, that doesn’t stop Begins from receiving some of Honest Trailers’ signature humorous barbs, including highlighting the multiple criminal acts that Batman commits in the supposed name of justice, such as attempted murder, arson, and manslaughter. As the narrator points out, it’s still murder if you have a train do it.\nPerhaps the biggest target of the narrator’s mockery is the League of Shadows’ rather absurd master plan involving vaporizing Gotham’s water supply and causing mass chaos using The Scarecrow’s fear toxin, which is arguably just as ridiculously illogical as anything Cesar Romero’s Joker might have come up with in the ’60s. To be fair though, at least Ra’s isn’t going around cracking one-liners about how the ice age killed the dinosaurs.\nSource: Screen Junkies\nThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing\nAd Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!\nOver 10,000 Videos!

{"cluster": 134, "text": "The following is a post that was originally featured on The Young Austinian and written by Katherine Hysmith, who is part of POPSUGAR Select Food.\nI already know what you're going to say. \"Butternut squash in an enchilada?! Have you forgotten your raisin' girl?\" But there's logic — in addition to damn tasty enchiladas — behind this idea; just hear me out. Do you remember the Native American story of the Three Sisters? Well, it refers to the three agricultural crops — specifically corn, squash, and beans — that grow so well together and create a complete vegetarian protein. In many Native communities, these plants were often grown together, as the corn and its stalks created a structure for the beans to climb, which, in turn, provided much-needed nitrogen for the soil. The squash, with its large shady leaves that grow and crawl like wildfire, provided ground cover and weed control. And the various amino acids in the beans and squash help the body break down the nutrients that we couldn't otherwise access in the corn.\nIf you serve these enchiladas with a side of beans — and just FYI, to do otherwise is considered blasphemy south of the Red River — and there you have a complete plate. Sweet, food scholar logic.\nAnd I know you're still thinking, \"but are these some kind of fancy vegetarian-friendly enchiladas?\" Well, yes, they are, but they are much, much more than that. When the roasted squash is baked with the shredded cheese, it creates this gooey filling that is so perfectly met with the acidic spice of the red sauce that you will never want plain ol' cheese enchiladas ever again. I'm almost hesitant to tell you, but in addition to all this, you are also eating a serving or two of a vegetable you might not otherwise eat. And I think it's high time I tell you that I, The Young Austinian, do not like squash of any kind. But with enough cheese and a distracting American folklore introduction, I'll eat just about anything.\nSince these take a bit of assembling, you can easily make these ahead of time (saving the last step) and refrigerate until ready to use (up to a day or so). The sauce is also easily made in advance and frankly tastes good on just about anything vaguely Tex-Mex related. These butternut squash enchiladas would also make a fitting, and filling, vegetarian entrée for any of the turkey averse at Friendsgiving or Thanksgiving gatherings.\n", "sentence_count": 21, "List": "6k", "unknown_words": ["american", "amino", "austinian", "averse", "blasphemy", "butternut", "enchilada", "enchiladas", "folklore", "friendsgiving", "fyi", "gooey", "hysmith", "katherine", "mex", "ol", "popsugar", "raisin", "tex", "thanksgiving", "turkey", "wildfire"], "simplified": "Katherine Hysmith from The Young Austinian introduces butternut squash enchiladas, a twist on traditional recipes. Inspired by the Native American \"Three Sisters\" farming technique, which combines corn, squash, and beans for nutritional balance and agricultural synergy, these enchiladas offer a complete vegetarian protein when served with beans. Despite initial skepticism, the roasted squash and cheese create a gooey filling perfectly complemented by the spicy red sauce. These enchiladas provide a delicious way to incorporate vegetables you might not usually eat. Although Katherine confesses a general dislike for squash, this recipe, combined with cheese and an engaging backstory, wins her over. You can prepare them ahead of time, refrigerate, and easily make the versatile sauce separately. They're a perfect vegetarian dish for Friendsgiving or Thanksgiving.", "simplified2": "The following post originally appeared on a blog by a writer from an online food community.\n\nYou might be thinking, \"Squash in an enchilada? Really?\" But there's a smart reason — and a tasty one — behind this idea. Listen to this: there's a story about three important crops — corn, squash, and beans — that grow well together and make a full plant-based protein. Traditionally, these plants were grown together by some people, with corn providing a structure for beans, which in turn helped the ground. Squash spread out, covering the ground and protecting it. The amino parts in beans and squash help our bodies use the food in corn.\n\nAdd beans to these enchiladas for a complete meal, which is a common practice in some regions. This makes logical sense, according to food experts.\n\nYou may wonder if these are fancy vegetarian enchiladas. They are, but they're more than that. When squash is roasted and baked with cheese, the gooey mix meets the zesty red sauce, making it better than just cheese enchiladas. Plus, you get to eat squash, a veggie you might not choose otherwise. Even the writer, who doesn't like squash, enjoys them with enough cheese and a storytelling introduction.\n\nThese may take time to prepare, but you can make them early and keep them in the fridge until you're ready (for about a day). The sauce can also be made ahead and tastes good with many dishes. These squash enchiladas can be a good dish for those who don't want turkey at family or holiday meals.", "simplified3": "This post, originally featured on The Young Austinian, was written by Katherine Hysmith from POPSUGAR Select Food.. I know what you'll say.. \"Butternut squash in an enchilada?! That's unusual, but trust me, there's a reason behind it beyond just being delicious.\". Remember the Native American story of the Three Sisters? It refers to the crops corn, squash, and beans that grow well together and form a complete vegetarian protein.. Native communities often grew these plants together because the corn stalks supported the climbing beans, which added nitrogen to the soil.. The squash's large leaves spread quickly, providing ground cover and weed control.. The amino acids in beans and squash help the body break down nutrients in the corn.. Serve these enchiladas with beans to complete the plate, as it's customary south of the Red River.. Sweet, logical food analysis. Yes, these are vegetarian-friendly enchiladas, but they're much more than that.. Baking roasted squash with shredded cheese creates a gooey filling that's perfectly complemented by the spicy red sauce, making plain cheese enchiladas seem less appealing.. I'm hesitant to say, but you're also eating a vegetable you might not usually eat.. I, The Young Austinian, should tell you that I don't like squash at all.. With enough cheese and some American folklore, I'll eat almost anything.. Assemble these in advance, refrigerate for up to a day, and complete the final step before using.. The sauce can be made ahead of time and enhances nearly any Tex-Mex dish.. These butternut squash enchiladas are a suitable and hearty vegetarian option for anyone who doesn't eat turkey at Friendsgiving or Thanksgiving.."}

{"cluster": 94, "text": "(CNN) — Taking selfies at a distance of about 12 inches from the face increases perceived nose size by nearly 30%, according to a report published Thursday in the journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery.\nResearchers now are cautioning that patients interested in cosmetic procedures should not turn to self-photographs as guidance when considering making changes to their faces.\n“Patients, people, even my family have to be aware that if you’re taking a selfie, it’s not really how you look,” said Dr. Boris Paskhover, a facial plastics and reconstructive surgeon at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and a leading author on the study.\n“Selfies make your nose look wider and thicker when it really isn’t, and people like a smaller nose,” Paskhover added. “My fear is that the generation out there now doesn’t know. All they know is the selfie.”\nSelfies have quickly become emblematic of our time, thanks in part to the popularity of social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram. Within its first year of existence, Google Photos saw more than 25 billion selfies uploaded onto its servers, according to Anil Sabharwal, vice president of Google Photos.\nRelated Content: Thousands Flock to Find Their Fine Arts Doppelganger in an App\nTo put that into perspective, there are about 8 billion people living on the entire planet.\nThe selfie phenomenon might be causing people to engage in surgeries based on photographs that distort their features, Paskhover says.\nAccording to a 2018 poll conducted by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, 55% of surgeons reported having patients who said they were seeking cosmetic procedures to improve their perceived appearance in selfies or other photos posted on social media in 2017, up from 42% in 2016.\nThe JAMA study relied on data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to approximate the facial dimensions of individuals from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds in the United States. Using mathematical modeling, the researchers found that photographs taken at a distance of 12 inches increased nose size by 30% in men and 29% in women compared with photographs taken at an infinite camera distance.\nPhotographs taken at a distance of 5 feet from the subject were not shown to significantly distort nasal dimensions.\n“At 5 feet, the distance between your nose and the camera and the distance between your facial plane and the camera is almost the same,” Paskhover said. “Because the difference is very small, the nose doesn’t get skewed.”\nIn 2017, there were about 17.5 million cosmetic surgical and minimally invasive cosmetic procedures performed in the US, a 2% increase from 2016 and a 200% increase from 2000, according to a report released Thursday by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\nOf these procedures, 218,924 were nose-reshaping cosmetic surgeries.\n“Overall, cosmetic surgeries are up again,” said Dr. Jeffrey Janis, chief of plastic surgery at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. “They have trended up over the last several years, and they continue to grow.\n“I think we are all aware of the power and influence of social media on cosmetic plastic surgery,” Janis added. “People are sharing images in real time in large numbers with people that they know and, in some cases, with people that they don’t.”\nNose reshaping, or rhinoplasty, was the third most common cosmetic surgical procedure in 2017. It typically costs $6,000 to $15,000 per procedure, according to Paskhover.\nBreast augmentation was the most common cosmetic surgery performed in 2017, accounting for over 300,000 procedures. Liposuction, eyelid surgery and tummy tucks were also among the top five cosmetic surgical procedures performed last year, according to the report.\n“I think people also feel more unencumbered, more free, to talk about plastic surgery in a way that doesn’t carry any sort of social stigma,” Janis added. “But I definitely think that there’s been a lot of interest because of selfie culture.”\nRhinoplasty and other forms of plastic surgery are generally considered to be safe, but as with any surgical procedure, there are risks involved. Complications such as infection, poor wound healing and skin discoloration still occur in a small number of cases, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\nBut the biggest risk is a disconnect between the patient’s expectations and reality, according to Janis.\n“The biggest risk in my mind is actually more around levels of expectation,” he said. “You need to make sure that, number one, the patient is an appropriate candidate, and number two, you have a very thorough conversation with the patient about having appropriate levels of expectation about what can be delivered.”\nBoth Janis and Paskhover also emphasized that finding a well-trained, board-certified plastic surgeon is an important factor in the success of any cosmetic procedure.\n“The biggest risk I see with rhinoplasty is that if you go to someone who’s inexperienced, aesthetic outcomes are variable,” Paskhover said.\n“It underscores the importance of public safety,” Janis said. “You don’t want somebody who didn’t get the necessary training and doesn’t operate in an accredited facility to be operating on you.”\n", "sentence_count": 41, "List": "6k", "unknown_words": ["american", "anil", "app", "boris", "cnn", "discoloration", "doppelganger", "emblematic", "eyelid", "facebook", "google", "instagram", "invasive", "jama", "janis", "jeffrey", "liposuction", "nasal", "ohio", "paskhover", "reconstructive", "reshaping", "rhinoplasty", "rutgers", "sabharwal", "selfie", "selfies", "skewed", "stigma", "tummy", "underscores", "unencumbered", "uploaded", "wexner"], "simplified": "A study in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery reveals that selfies taken from 12 inches away can make the nose appear 30% larger, leading researchers to warn against using these images to guide decisions on cosmetic procedures.

{"cluster": 143, "text": "KABUL (Reuters) - Enayatullah Balegh is a professor at Kabul University and preaches on Fridays in the largest mosque in central Kabul, where he advocates jihad, or holy war, against foreigners who desecrate Islam.\nAfter a fundamentalist U.S. pastor presided over the burning of a copy of the Koran last month, there has been a growing perception among ordinary people that many of the foreigners in Afghanistan belong in just one category: the infidels.\n“The international community and the American government is responsible for this gravest insult to Muslims,” Balegh told Reuters in the blue-and-white tiled Hazrat Ali mosque.\n“I tell my students to wage jihad against all foreigners who desecrate our religious values. We have had enough.”\nProtests in Kabul against the Koran-burning have not become violent but there are many other mullahs in the overcrowded capital whose sermons are filled with criticism of the foreigners fighting and working in Afghanistan.\nIn Kabul’s northwest, firebrand Habibullah Asaam warns his congregation that all contact with non-Muslims is dangerous.\n“The Jews and crusaders can never be friends of Muslims, they are the despoilers of our society and culture,” he said during Friday sermons. Worshippers cried “Allahu Akbar” -- God is greatest -- in response.\n“Those who want them here are cowardly Muslims. Women avoid wearing veils, men chase fashion and show off, it’s all because of the foreigners,” he said.\nWith few Dari or Pashto-speaking foreigners in the country, the messages broadcast from mosques by loudspeakers often pass unnoticed by the people they are condemning.\nBut the extent and impact of anti-Western sentiment was brought into stark relief last week when a protest in normally peaceful Mazar-i-Sharif city in the north ended with the frenzied killing of seven foreign U.N. workers.\nThe demonstrators had spent hours listening to incendiary preaching from outspoken clerics like Abdul Rahoof Tawana, who told worshippers “we must avenge the burning of the Koran.”\nAfter the attack, the provincial governor urged imams to avoid talking about politics and ordered police to round up audio tapes containing “hate” speeches.\nDEEP INFLUENCE\nIn a deeply religious country where most men go to Friday prayers every week, sermons are a critical part of efforts to battle insurgents who have emerged from religious schools and mosques, and usually claim the religious high ground.\nWhile there is no formal hierarchy like Christian churches, the government does have some leverage over the imams.\nIt pays the salaries of many of them, President Hamid Karzai can count many powerful clerics among his senior officials and advisers -- Tawana is a member of Afghanistan’s national ulema, or council of senior clerics -- and the Religious Affairs Ministry gives speech notes to some imams.\n“Sometimes mullahs preach beyond whatever we want but there is no resources to control all mosques in the country,” Israr-ul-Haq, a deputy for the department of Mosques and Other Holy Sites, told Reuters.\nHe said there are about 160,000 mosques in the country and only 3,000 of them are registered with the government. Others are built by the people and their imams are fed and supported by that neighborhood, he said.\n“Mullahs have their own problems. If they speak against government policies, they are either harassed or detained by security forces,” Israr-ul-Haq said. “If they speak in favor of the government, then they are killed by insurgents.”\nKarzai does not seem to have the appetite or influence to face down powerful clerics, and it is hard to follow the contents of sermons in thousands of smaller mosques scattered in remote towns and villages across the country.\nIn rural areas where the Taliban are most active, Friday sermons are often in favor of the insurgency.\nKhan Mohammad, an influential elder in southern Helmand province, said insurgents order imams to condemn NATO troops as “foreign invaders” and the government as a puppet regime.\nAmong both those who were far away, and those who joined the Mazar riots but not the killing, there were many who did not condemn the violence. And although insurgents played a key role, it was ordinary protesters who overwhelmed security in the United Nations’ Mazar compound and helped hunt down the victims.\nBillions of dollars and nearly 10 years into the war, where diplomats point to schools, clinics and an army rebuilt with Western help, the fury that can drive or condone that kind of killing is something many Westerners do not want to look into.\nAnti-Western sentiment is strong in Afghanistan, which is traditionally conservative, deeply religious and suspicious of outsiders. The welcome foreign troops got from many parts of the country in 2001 has slowly soured.\n“There is a lot of anger after years in which Western military operations have caused an accumulation of civilian casualty cases,” wrote Thomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts’ Network, in an article on the killing.\nThe affluent lives of many Westerners and officials perceived as corrupt does not help. Ordinary citizens see little benefit from the billions of aid dollars and suffer regular human rights abuses, adding to frustrations.\n“As if air strikes on civilians, violence and bloodshed was not enough, now they have burned the Koran,” said Tawab Rustami, a 24-year-old university student.\n“The conflict is because of the foreigners, it is better for them to leave before things get worse,” he said.\n", "sentence_count": 41, "List": "6k", "unknown_words": ["abdul", "afghanistan", "akbar", "ali", "allahu", "american", "anti", "asaam", "avenge", "balegh", "bloodshed", "christian", "clerics", "condone", "cowardly", "dari", "desecrate", "despoilers", "enayatullah", "firebrand", "gravest", "habibullah", "hamid", "haq", "hazrat", "helmand", "imams", "incendiary", "infidels", "islam", "israr", "jews", "jihad", "kabul", "karzai", "khan", "koran", "loudspeakers", "mazar", "mohammad", "mullahs", "muslims", "n", "nato", "non", "outspoken", "pashto", "rahoof", "reuters", "rustami", "ruttig", "sharif", "taliban", "tawab", "tawana", "thomas", "u", "ul", "ulema"], "simplified": "Enayatullah Balegh, a professor and preacher in Kabul, advocates jihad against foreigners desecrating Islam, especially after a U.S. pastor burned a Koran.

In the northwest, a speaker warns against interacting with non-believers, calling them harmful to their culture.\n\nMessages spoken in local languages often go unnoticed by foreigners. However, the deep resentment was clear when a protest in a northern city led to the deaths of seven foreign workers after fiery talks by influential speakers.\n\nThe local leader asked religious figures to stay away from political topics and instructed the police to confiscate recordings with harmful messages.\n\nReligious talks are important since some fighters come from religious schools and claim moral high ground. Though there is no strict structure like churches, the government influences some religious leaders by paying their salaries. The president gets advice from some influential figures, and some officials provide notes for speeches.\n\nA deputy head of religious sites noted challenges in monitoring due to too many unregistered places of worship in the country, and some speakers feel pressure from both government and fighters.\n\nThe president is reluctant to confront strong religious figures, and it is difficult to monitor speeches from many small places spread across remote areas where fighters are active.

Unfortunately, the sentence is incomplete, so I can't simplify it while preserving the meaning. Could you please provide the rest of the sentence?. After a pastor burned a Koran last month, many Afghans increasingly view foreigners as infidels.. \"The international community and the American government are responsible for this grave insult to Muslims,\" Balegh told Reuters at the Hazrat Ali mosque.. I urge my students to fight against foreigners who disrespect our religious values.. Protests in Kabul against the Koran-burning remain peaceful, but many local mullahs still criticize the foreign presence in Afghanistan.. In northwest Kabul, Habibullah Asaam cautions his congregation against any contact with non-Muslims.. He said during Friday sermons, \"Jews and crusaders cannot be friends of Muslims, as they harm our society and culture.\". Worshippers cried \"Allahu Akbar,\" meaning \"God is greatest,\" in response.. Those who support them being here are cowardly Muslims.. He blamed foreigners for women avoiding veils and men chasing fashion and showing off.. Few foreigners in the country speak Dari or Pashto, so mosque loudspeaker messages often go unnoticed by those they condemn.. The impact of anti-Western sentiment became clear last week when a protest in the usually peaceful city of Mazar-i-Sharif resulted in the frenzied killing of seven foreign U.N. staff.. The sentence appears to be incomplete. Could you provide more context or the complete sentence?. After the attack, the governor urged imams to avoid political topics and ordered police to seize \"hate\" speech tapes, following hours of incendiary preaching by clerics like Abdul Rahoof Tawana, who urged avenging the Koran's burning.. In a deeply religious country, weekly Friday sermons are crucial in combating insurgents from religious schools and mosques who often assert religious authority.. Although there is no formal hierarchy like in Christian churches, the government still has some influence over the imams.. President Hamid Karzai employs many powerful clerics as senior officials and advisers, including Tawana, a member of Afghanistan's national ulema, while the Religious Affairs Ministry provides speech notes to some imams.. \"Mullahs sometimes preach against our wishes, but we lack the resources to monitor all mosques nationwide,\" said Israr-ul-Haq, a deputy from the department of Mosques and Other Holy Sites, to Reuters.. He stated that out of 160,000 mosques in the country, only 3,000 are government-registered.. He said that some are built by the people, and their imams are supported by the neighborhood.. Mullahs face their own issues.. Israr-ul-Haq said that speaking against government policies results in harassment or detention by security forces.. Karzai lacks the ability or desire to challenge influential clerics, and it is difficult to monitor sermons in numerous small mosques in remote areas.. In rural areas with strong Taliban activity, Friday sermons often support the insurgency.. Khan Mohammad, a key elder in southern Helmand, stated that insurgents tell imams to denounce NATO as \"foreign invaders\" and the government as a puppet.. Many people, whether far away or participating in the Mazar riots but not the killing, did not condemn the violence.. While insurgents were key, ordinary protesters overwhelmed UN security at the Mazar compound and helped hunt down the victims.. After billions of dollars and almost 10 years in the war, with schools, clinics, and an army rebuilt by the West, many Westerners avoid examining the rage that drives such killings.. Afghanistan, being traditionally conservative, religious, and wary of outsiders, has strong anti-Western sentiment.. The warm reception of foreign troops in 2001 has gradually turned negative.. \"Years of Western military operations causing numerous civilian casualties have led to widespread anger,\" wrote Thomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts’ Network, regarding the killing.. The wealthy lifestyles of many Westerners and corrupt officials are unhelpful.. Ordinary citizens gain little from aid and suffer human rights abuses, increasing frustrations.. \"Air strikes on civilians and violence weren't enough; now they've burned the Koran,\" said 24-year-old student Tawab Rustami.. He said, \"The conflict is due to the foreigners; it's better if they leave before things worsen.\"."}

As it stands, however, the bill promises to make helicopters a key element in the United State’s defense strategy. With a particular emphasis on anti-submarine technology, these helicopters also represent a sustainable approach to defense based on current military equipment holdings.\nHelicopters Meet Submarines\nWhile helicopters are often seen as primarily transport vehicles, ideal for accessing areas without airport access, from a military perspective they’re capable of much more. Specifically, when it comes to hunting enemy submarines, helicopters are ideal weapons because they can typically get closer to the water level to detect submarines and they also operate from ship-borne bases. If they don’t sink the submarine, their own base could go down.\nThe US military is especially concerned about Russian submarine warfare at present; in fact, all of NATO is concerned about the Russian submarine threat. Luckily, due to improvements made to the systems a few years ago, US helicopters are now designed to track Russian and Chinese submarines. NATO parties have also spent more time practicing submarine tracking and targeting in recent years.\nFurther Advances Expected\nIn addition to the improvements made to military helicopters several years ago, the Navy is also scheduled to begin mid-life improvements on anti-submarine warfare equipment beginning in FY 2020. Such improvements will draw on recent technological advances such as Doppler navigation, which will replace earlier systems on the Apache Longbow GPS and INS. Such integrated systems are similar enough to prior GPS systems to minimize training costs and also work with existing communications systems – and like other US military technology, it’s likely to be in demand on the international market.\nCompeting National Interests\nOne major concern regarding improved military technology is the fact that very few of these equipment changes are secret in today’s marketplace, and that means other countries want to invest in the same equipment. India, for example, is interested in purchasing MH-60 Romeos, submarine hunting helicopters used by the US military, while the 2019 NDAA actually contained wording prohibiting the US military from doing business with Chinese telecom giant ZTE, before Trump announced the ban would be lifted. When it comes to security and military equipment, secrecy is a thing of the past, and that’s transforming how we prepare for war.\nOther Helicopter Advances\nIn addition to submarine hunting technology, US military helicopters will likely see other technological advances in 2019-2020, including introduction of new self-flying technology that’s been in the works for the past four years, better obstacle avoidance using LIDAR, and tools to prevent helicopter crashes. These new tools are all designed around what the Army calls “mission adaptive autonomy,” which essentially enables the aircraft to take over basic flight mechanisms when the human pilot is needed to perform more complex tasks, such as transporting injured soldiers or providing ground support.\nHelicopters rarely get the level of attention that fighter planes do in conversations about military spending, but from a defense perspective they’re equally important, and the 2019 NDAA makes that clear. By prioritizing advancements for existing helicopter technology, the forthcoming military budget should keep costs down while also providing the military with the tools needed to protect our country.\nRelated Content\nShop Google\n", "sentence_count": 20, "List": "7k", "unknown_words": ["advancements", "airport", "anti", "apache", "chinese", "doppler", "facebook", "fy", "google", "gps", "india", "lidar", "linkedin", "longbow", "marketplace", "mh", "mid", "nato", "ndaa", "pinterest", "romeos", "russian", "twitter", "whatsapp", "zte"], "simplified": "President Trump approved a $717 billion defense budget for 2019, but full funding needs Congress to pass the government budget.

The U.S. and NATO are particularly concerned about Russian submarine threats, and recent upgrades have improved U.S. helicopters' ability to track Russian and Chinese submarines. The Navy plans more anti-submarine equipment advancements starting in FY 2020, including Doppler navigation technology for improved tracking, which is cost-effective in training and compatible with current systems. However, the global interest in similar technologies poses a challenge, as secrecy in military advancements is dwindling. Despite these concerns, India is interested in purchasing U.S. submarine-hunting helicopters, and the 2019 NDAA initially banned working with Chinese company ZTE, though Trump lifted this ban. New helicopter technologies, such as self-flying capabilities, obstacle avoidance, and crash prevention, are expected in 2019-2020.

These systems are similar to past ones, reducing training costs, and they work with current communications systems. They are likely to be in demand internationally.\n\nNational Interests\n\nMilitary technology improvements often aren't secret, meaning other countries also want this equipment.

Richardson checks in with the disgraced athlete and cancer survivor for a lengthy interview. The piece, titled \"Lance Armstrong in Purgatory: The Afterlife\" reveals a downsized but still defiant Armstrong ego — a man adjusting to and still coping with his remarkable fall from the apex of athletics to widespread derision and infamy.\nPHOTOS Stars Behaving Badly: From Justin Bieber to Reese Witherspoon, Hollywood's Recent Mugshots\nHere are six of the most surprising revelations from the interview.\n1) He plays golf now and rarely cycles\nArmstrong reveals that he always hated golf, but now that he's essentially unemployed, he's taken to playing the game five times a week. Writes Richardson: \"The game isn't natural to him. You have to swivel your hips and his legs were all about up and down. Now he takes lessons, plays eighteen holes, then goes home to watch golf on TV. … Armstrong just shrugs. \"What else am I gonna do?\"\nMore striking, given his renowned training regimens during the glory days, he seldom cycles now.\n\"It's like, I don't really care,\" he says, a little mystified. \"It's weird.\"\n2) He regrets the lying and bullying, but remains defiant about doping\n\"To this day, in any forum available to him, Armstrong refuses to repent on the main charge against him. He seems sincere in his regret for lying so insistently and suing people who tried to expose him, but on the charge of doping he simply cannot form his lips around the pious apology the public expects.\"\nArmstrong insists he had a simple choice: He could either do what it took to win (cheat) or go back to work at a bike shop in Austin. He cites Michael Irvin, the Dallas Cowboys star receiver of the 1990s, as a sort of inspiration: \"I mean, he was getting busted with strippers and cocaine and shit.

He keeps his profile and communications mostly private now, however. When he does pop his head up publicly on social media, it tends to get bludgeoned.\nAfter a cancer victim Armstrong was close with passed away, he posted a small heartfelt Facebook tribute: \"RIP Jimmy Fowkes,\" it read. \"You have forever touched my life as well as millions of others.

They expected that perfect story.\"\n6) He still means a great deal to many cancer survivors\nThe article is peppered with anecdotes from cancer survivors about the personal video messages they received from Armstrong and the pivotal role he played in their recovery. Richardson's reporting also reveals that Armstrong has discreetly hosted a fundraiser for a camp for sick kids and hopes to reconcile with Livestrong.

Now, physicians tailor their advice to each patient's case. In many instances, however, it's difficult for physicians to gauge what types of risk their patient might be facing.\nA new study designed to clarify those risks found that women with lupus during pregnancy — and even women who may soon be diagnosed with lupus — are more likely to experience preeclampsia, stroke and infection than women without lupus. Infants born to mothers with lupus or pre-lupus are also more likely to be born preterm, have infections, or be small for gestational age, according to the paper, which was published today in Arthritis Care and Research.\n\"We’ve confirmed previous findings while strengthening the data to show that lupus is associated with a variety of adverse pregnancy outcomes both to the mother, and to the infant,\" said senior author Julia Simard, ScD, assistant professor of health research and policy at Stanford.\nThe research team, which included collaborators in Sweden and at several U.S. universities, examined data from population-based Swedish registers.

He declined to offer additional details on when or in what capacity the carmaker would expand in Brazil.\nToyota has a market share of about 9 percent in Brazil, where it sells the Etios subcompact hatchback and the Corolla and Camry sedans, along with SUVs and trucks. Any expansion there will see it come up against market leaders FCA, General Motors Co, and Volkswagen AG.\nBrazil, a top-10 global market for cars, could be a tough market for expansion as a deepening recession and political uncertainty has sapped auto sales in recent years. The country posted total sales of about 2 million in 2016, having fallen sharply from 3.5 million in 2010.\nDaihatsu is Japan’s largest maker of minicars with engines no bigger than 660cc made specifically for the domestic market as a low-cost alternative to passenger cars. Toyota has already enlisted Daihatsu to help develop compact cars for emerging markets including India.\nToyota President Akio Toyoda last month said he was betting on minicar technology to simplify the way it manufactures regular cars at lower cost. Toyota has set up in-house companies to specialise in small cars and emerging markets, which are big markets for smaller models.\nOkudaira said the two companies were still mulling their strategy for India and other emerging markets, including whether to launch compact cars under the Daihatsu or Toyota brands and securing a high-quality supply chain.\nToyota has struggled to grow its market share at the affordable end of India’s car market, a sector dominated by domestic rival Suzuki Motor Corp.

He didn't specify details about the company’s expansion in Brazil, where Toyota holds a 9% market share, selling small cars, sedans, SUVs, and trucks. Competing with leaders like FCA, General Motors, and Volkswagen, Toyota looks to grow in this volatile market.

Automaker 2 wants to use its smaller partner’s expertise in affordable, reliable small cars to improve its own models amid high costs and tough global competition in making more advanced cars.. Daihatsu President Soichiro Okudaira stated on Wednesday that there is a market for compact cars in Brazil.. Toyota sells similar models in Asia and South America, with Brazil being a key market for slightly larger models like the Corolla. Okudaira, the chief engineer of the recent Corolla series, recently left Toyota to lead Daihatsu.. He didn't provide further details on the carmaker's expansion timing or role in Brazil.. Toyota holds a 9% market share in Brazil, selling the Etios, Corolla, Camry, SUVs, and trucks.. Expansion there will face market leaders FCA, General Motors, and Volkswagen.. Brazil, a leading global car market, could be a difficult expansion target due to recession and political uncertainty affecting auto sales in recent years.. The country's sales dropped from 3.5 million in 2010 to about 2 million in 2016.. Daihatsu is Japan's largest producer of minicars with engines up to 660cc, designed as a low-cost alternative to passenger cars for the domestic market.. Toyota has enlisted Daihatsu to help develop compact cars for emerging markets like India.. Last month, Toyota President Akio Toyoda said he is focusing on minicar technology to reduce manufacturing costs for regular cars.. Toyota has established in-house companies to focus on small cars and emerging markets, which are major markets for smaller models.. Okudaira said the two companies were still considering their strategy for India and other emerging markets, including whether to launch compact cars under the Daihatsu or Toyota brands and ensuring a high-quality supply chain.. Toyota has struggled to increase its market share in India's affordable car sector, which is dominated by Suzuki Motor Corp..

A couple of flapper-style lace, chiffon and tulle look also evoked the joyful feeling of the 1920s — the period between the two World Wars.\nThe studio team also set about experimenting with the famed “bar jacket” — it “changes appearance depending on whether it is worn closed or loose,” said the program notes.\nIt thus came in myriad forms: in tight, embroidered black wool, loose and white, open to expose the breast sensually, oversized and masculine, or as a beautiful dark navy wool coat.\nThere were also traces of the historical musings of past creative directors — such as Galliano and Simons — set off nicely in one look off-white wool “bar” jacket interpretation with flappy 18th-century cuffs.\nSCHIAPARELLI’S GASTRO-COUTURE\nActress Bosworth — who sported an elegant chignon — hit the Schiaparelli front row on Monday, taking her seat next to pop singer, model, and former French First Lady Carla Bruni — distracting some by talking on her cellphone.\nIn the collection, designer Bertrand Guyon continued to explore the fascinating universe of couturier Elsa Schiaparelli in his sophomore outing for the house.\nOn the creative menu at the Monday morning show was fashion gastronomy.\nIt was an interesting way showcase the eccentricity of the vivacious “Schiap,” as she was known, who loved eating well.\nCrockery lined the walls of the show venue, as daywear looks inspired by the table — such as botanical diagrams and vegetable prints — opened the show on light, sporty skirt suits.\nAt times, it worked well — but occasionally the ideas translated too obviously, like one cream floorlength gown based on a red striped table cloth motif with plates on it.\nThe collection experienced a crescendo however as the looks moved into the evening.\nBy then, fashionistas could almost hear their stomachs rumbling.\nRALPH & RUSSO’S STAR POWER\nProving there are serious contenders in the couture calendar, relative newcomers Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo are drawing the big names to their collections. Pulp Fiction star Thurman set off the cameras naps arriving in a LBD and silk shawl at the Monday afternoon show.\nThe youthful-looking 45-year-old is in the City of Light to attend a private dinner hosted by the couture house and by French jewelry brand Chopoard.\nThe house say the event will be “celebrating the finest savoir-faire” of couture — and will include a musical performance by Ora.\nVALLI CHANNELS 60S AND EMPIRE LINES\nA strong ’60s influence infused Giambattista Valli’s vision for spring — as ever, served up in a long line of cocktail dresses and floor length gowns.\nA silk jacquard cocktail dress in two-tone grey sported a tight retro bodice and A-line mini.\nAnother silk crepe dress with delicate embroidered flowers had voluminous organza ruffles at the sleeve that evoked the silhouette of a bolero jacket, also popular in that era.\nAs the looks progressed, the dresses got more structural — riffing off the Empire Line silhouette, in one instance on a dress in printed lily of the valley with a tight, embroidered paillette bustier.\nThe floor-sweeping draped silk mousseline dresses at the end of the collection also evoked the delicate Romanticism of this early 19th-century style.\n", "sentence_count": 44, "List": "8k", "unknown_words": ["anna", "atelier", "belgian", "bernadette", "bertrand", "bodice", "bolero", "bosworth", "british", "bruni", "carla", "cellphone", "chiffon", "chignon", "chinese", "chirac", "chopoard", "christian", "cinch", "couture", "couturier", "crepe", "crescendo", "crockery", "cutout", "cutouts", "daywear", "dior", "donatella", "doyenne", "elsa", "faire", "fashionistas", "flapper", "flappy", "floorlength", "freestyle", "french", "galliano", "gastro", "gastronomy", "giambattista", "guyon", "italian", "jacquard", "john", "jumpsuit", "kate", "lbd", "liu", "michael", "mousseline", "newcomers", "ora", "organza", "oversized", "paillette", "paillettes", "paparazzi", "pared", "paris", "parisian", "parisienne", "raf", "ralph", "retro", "riffing", "rita", "rodin", "romanticism", "russo", "savoir", "schiap", "schiaparelli", "showcase", "simons", "sophomore", "soundtrack", "sported", "tamara", "thurman", "tulle", "uma", "underwear", "valiant", "valli", "vendome", "versace", "vivacious", "voluminous", "wintour", "yifei"], "simplified": "PARIS — The spring-summer couture shows launched on Monday, attracting celebrities like Uma Thurman and Kate Bosworth.

{"cluster": 90, "text": "A UFO hunter has announced the latest bizarre “discovery” in the field of Mars anomaly research — a humanoid alien skull spotted in an image of Martian terrain captured by NASA’s Curiosity rover.\nThe discovery of an alien humanoid skull on the Red Planet by NASA’s Curiosity rover, according to UFO hunters, offers clinching evidence of advanced ancient humanoid civilization on Mars.\nUFO hunter Paranormal Crucible announced the discovery in a video uploaded to YouTube on June 6. According to the prolific Mars anomaly hunter, the discovery was made in an image taken recently by Curiosity rover’s Mastcam: Left (MAST_LEFT) on Sol 1352 (2016-05-26 05:16:25 UTC). The NASA image, according to Paranormal Crucible, who describes his YouTube channel as “Home Of The Bizarre,” shows a humanoid alien skull that resembles a “Sasquatch skull.”\nParanormal Crucible observes that the strange object “appears to resemble a large skull, obviously alien in nature.”\n“Could it be the remains of a Sasquatch or a bizarre Martian creature?” the UFO hunter wonders.\nAccording to UFO blogger Scott C. Waring, the object is evidently an ancient skull representing one of several alien species that thrived on Mars before Mars civilization was wiped out in a horrific nuclear holocaust millions of years ago.\nThe theory that ancient Mars civilization was wiped out in a nuclear holocaust is championed by Dr. John Brandenburg, theoretical plasma physicist and expert in propulsion technologies, who holds a PhD from the University of California at Davis.\nHe elaborated the strange theory in a controversial paper, titled, “Evidence of Massive Thermonuclear Explosions in Mars Past, The Cydonian Hypothesis and Fermi’s Paradox.”\nThe paper was first presented at the 2014 Annual Fall meeting of the American Physical Society, Prairie Section in Monmouth, Illinois.\nHe also presented the theory in March 2015, at the 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston, Texas, the Inquisitr reported.\nHe claimed there is evidence that two ancient Mars civilizations — Cydonia and the Utopia — were wiped out in a series of massive thermonuclear weapons explosions set off by hostile alien invaders.\nCommenting further on the alleged discovery of an alien skull on Mars, UFO blogger Scott Waring notes that “the skull is big, about the same size as a human skull.”\n“I don’t believe it is a helmet,” he adds. “A helmet would not have a perfectly formed nose area. Also the two ridges along one side are similar to ridges along bones found on Earth.”\n“The skull is big, about the same size as a human skull.”\nParanormal Crucible’s announcement of the discovery of a humanoid alien skull on Mars sparked lively discussions on multiple alien and UFO conspiracy theory forums.\nSome alien hunters agreed with Waring and Paranormal Crucible that the object was likely an alien skull. But some insisted it was more likely an ancient military helmet.\nA few who could not make up their minds suggested that NASA operators should move the rover closer to the object for a clearer view and maybe even use the rover’s robotic arm to tip it over.\n“I believe it is a helmet; petrified of course,” an alien enthusiast said.\n“We really need the rover to move over there and get a closer look,” another said, “even using the rover arm to tip it over to check it out would help.”\n“It looks like a helmet to me,” a third commented in support of the first enthusiast.\n“I would say it looks more like a skull than a helmet,” a fourth countered.\nOne enthusiast thought it “looks more like the head of a statue, rather than a skull. It reminds me of those old Greek style bronze statues where the eyes are hollow.”\nBut others found the evidence tantalizingly inconclusive.\n“I don’t know how true this maybe, but it’s interesting none the less,” an enthusiast commented.\nUncertainty whether the object was a skull or a helmet and the unlikelihood of getting NASA to move Curiosity rover closer to inspect the object sparked protests and accusations of cover-up against NASA.\n“We just want the truth! It’s not very hard?” a conspiracy theorist protested.\nIn the wacky world of Mars anomaly research, an alien skull is an unremarkable discovery.\nProbably the wackiest discovery ever by Mars anomaly hunters was a live chicken on Mars (see footage above).\nLess remarkable was the discovery of a fossil fish on Mars in April.\nIntrepid UFO hunters have found hundreds of crashed alien flying saucers and drones on the Red Planet.\nOthers have found conifer-like trees growing on the Red Planet. One alien hunter found a “weaponized robotic machine” roaming the Martian surface earlier in the week.\nSome time ago, a creative UFO hunter found an alien handgun left on Mars by a careless alien visitor.\n[Image via Shutterstock]\n", "sentence_count": 45, "List": "9k", "unknown_words": ["american", "blogger", "brandenburg", "c", "california", "crucible", "cydonia", "cydonian", "davis", "fermi", "greek", "handgun", "holocaust", "houston", "humanoid", "illinois", "inquisitr", "intrepid", "john", "martian", "mastcam", "monmouth", "nasa", "paranormal", "phd", "sasquatch", "scott", "shutterstock", "sol", "texas", "thermonuclear", "ufo", "uploaded", "utc", "wackiest", "wacky", "waring", "weaponized", "youtube"], "simplified": "A UFO hunter announced a new \"discovery\" of a humanoid alien skull on Mars, captured by NASA's Curiosity rover.

This idea is supported by Dr. John B., who introduced a theory about ancient nuclear explosions on Mars at a science meeting. He claimed that two Martian groups were destroyed by nuclear weapons from hostile aliens.\n\nThe discussion about the skull created a lot of talk online.

A few people suggested that NASA should move the rover closer for a better look, perhaps even using the rover's arm to examine it.\n\nSome people argued the object looked more like a statue's head, while others remained unsure.

APS was given the the second-lowest rating a school district can receive, the Accredited with Priority Improvement Plan. According to the official District Performance Framework report, APS is struggling most with academic achievement.\n“Over the past few years, we have implemented an aggressive reform strategy to improve our lowest-performing schools,” said APS Superintendent Rico Munn. “We are seeing these reforms take shape with many areas of growth and improvement, but we know that this growth is not happening fast enough.

{"cluster": 52, "text": "As Senator Roméo Dallaire, Canada’s best-known traumatized soldier, launches the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta’s Circle on Mental Health & Addiction and Queen’s University unveils its own mental health commission in response to a series of suicides, both may cast a cautionary eye on the travails of the Mental Health Commission of Canada, a 10-year, $130-million federal project.\nSince a draft of its national strategy on mental health was leaked this summer, the agency has been squirming under accusations of dysfunction, anti-psychiatry bias and neglect of the most serious mental illnesses.\nCritics point out the 30-page document mentions “recovery” 67 times and “support” 125 times, but there is no reference to “psychiatry.” Or “schizophrenia” or “bipolar.”\nIn a “letter to Canadians” last month, Louise Bradley, the agency’s chief executive, promised to “correct” the strategy before its planned release next year, because “the current draft does not sufficiently reflect the essential role neuroscience, treatment and psychiatry have to play.”\nIn doing so, the MHCC is trying to strike a balance between the two major ideologies of mental health: empowerment, based in social science, in which recovery is seen as a personal growth experience; and psychiatry, based in neuroscience, in which recovery sometimes must be imposed against a delusional will.\nAt its most extreme, this clash of ideologies turns on the question of whether the fundamental problem of mental illness lies in the brain itself, or in the stigma imposed by society.\nAt stake is a key part of the MHCC’s dual mandate — to develop a national strategy on mental health — which will influence the allocation of research funding and the priorities provinces set on this unique issue, spanning health care and social policy.\nThe other part of its mandate is to combat the stigma of mental illness through public outreach and professional advocacy, which have largely focused on health-care providers, often the first point of contact between the mentally ill and the government.\nAs the strategy gets revised, the ideological balance continues to elude the MHCC, although a spokesman said the flawed draft is “relatively close,” and the Commission stands by it “fundamentally.”\nFocused on “recovery,” the draft strategy highlights suicide prevention, self-directed care, improvement over cure, and calls for an end to the seclusion and restraint of psychiatric patients.\nHowever, its focus on health promotion and prevention, including the role of employers in creating healthy workplaces, has fuelled criticism that this is not a strategy about mental illness, but rather mental wellness.\n“They’ve stolen the word ‘recovery,’ ” said Herschel Hardin, president of the North Shore Schizophrenia Society in B.C., whose latest bulletin accuses the commission of hiding behind upbeat euphemisms and claims “those who understand severe mental illness no longer take [the MHCC] seriously — except to regard it as a menace.”\nHe said the agency exaggerates the notion recovery cannot be imposed by others and must be a self-directed personal achievement.\n“For the seriously ill, that’s a small part of recovery that comes after treatment for the illness itself, which is part of recovery, which requires a lot of not just support but structure, provided by others,” he said.\n“Here [at the MHCC] we have a bunch of people who really haven’t done the homework that they had to do, and buried the most important considerations in bureaucratic fluff and vague wording.”\nMore than most health issues, vocabulary clouds this debate.\nPatients are recast as “survivors,” “consumers,” or “experts by experience” on the one side, and a schizophrenic’s lack of insight medicalized into “anosognosia” on the other.\n“The idea of recovery in mental illness circles has a certain meaning that is not translated well for the general public,” said Bill Honer, head of the department of psychiatry at the University of British Columbia and a clinical expert on schizophrenia.\nIt is not like remission in cancer, in which the disease metaphorically retreats, or recovery from a cold, in which it disappears completely. Recovery in mental health, as the MHCC describes it, is an orientation, a way of life.\nThe danger, Prof. Honer said, is that a strategy in which individuals must guide themselves to recovery could be unfair to those who are unable to do so, because they cannot understand their own illness.\n“On a strict interpretation [of that strategy], we risk not fulfilling our social responsibilities,” he said.\nAt the same time, there is rampant confusion about these words and what they imply, he said. “The social constructs of labelling and diagnosis are real, but it’s not the same as what we do [in psychiatry]. Having a diagnosis is not a bad thing. That’s how we work. But labelling and stigma are, and that’s how society works.”\nMs. Bradley refused to be interviewed, but strategic advisor Howard Chodos, who prepared the draft strategy, said it was developed through face-to-face meetings and an online survey.\nThe “vast majority” of participants in consultations were “supportive of the overall thrust of the strategy,” he said, but the review process now includes “some of more public discussion that’s taken place once the draft reached a wider audience than we originally intended.”\n“Was everybody included? No. Did we have the resources to do that at this time? No,” he added.\n“But we felt confident that we would get the kind of feedback from that group that would enable us to strengthen the document.”\nMr. Chodos acknowledged the criticism and said the draft’s language “is not where we would like it to be, in terms of connecting with people, resonating with people in a way that will help to galvanize support for the document.”\nBut he rejects the notion that the focus on consensus obscures the hard cases.\n“What I don’t accept is that there is a fundamental opposition between those two elements,” he said.\n“We can find a way to have that balance, and we’re not sacrificing one on the altar of the other.”\nNational Post\njbrean@nationalpost.com\n", "sentence_count": 46, "List": "9k", "unknown_words": ["alberta", "anosognosia", "anti", "b", "bradley", "british", "c", "canada", "canadians", "chodos", "columbia", "dallaire", "feedback", "hardin", "herschel", "homework", "howard", "jbrean", "louise", "medicalized", "mhcc", "nationalpost", "neuroscience", "online", "recast", "spokesman", "traumatized", "travails", "wellness", "workplaces"], "simplified": "Senator Roméo Dallaire is launching the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta’s Circle on Mental Health & Addiction, and Queen’s University is unveiling its own mental health commission in response to recent suicides.

The MHCC’s draft national strategy mentions “recovery” and “support” frequently but omits terms like “psychiatry,” “schizophrenia,” and “bipolar.”\n\nIn a letter, MHCC chief Louise Bradley promised to revise the strategy to better reflect the roles of neuroscience and psychiatry. The MHCC is balancing empowerment, which views recovery as personal growth, with psychiatry, which may involve imposed recovery. This ideological clash centers on whether mental illness is brain-related or societal stigma-related. The MHCC’s mandate includes developing a national mental health strategy and combating mental illness stigma through public outreach.\n\nThe draft strategy emphasizes suicide prevention, self-directed care, and health promotion, drawing criticism for focusing on mental wellness rather than illness.

Vocabulary complicates the debate, as terms like “survivors” or “experts by experience” differ from medical terminology like \"anosognosia.\"\n\nBill Honer, a psychiatry expert, warns that a self-guided recovery strategy may be unfair to those unable to understand their illness.

A draft of its mental health strategy leaked in the summer, leading to accusations of dysfunction, bias, and neglect of serious mental disorders.\n\nCritics note the 30-page document mentions “recovery” 67 times and “support” 125 times but lacks mention of “psychiatry,” “schizophrenia,” or “bipolar.” In a letter last month, Louise Bradley, the agency’s chief, promised changes to the strategy, acknowledging it did not sufficiently include neuroscience, treatment, and psychiatry.\n\nThe commission balances two major mental health ideologies: one based in social science focusing on personal growth, and another in neuroscience, where recovery may need to be enforced against a person's will. This clash questions if the main problem of mental illness is in the brain or due to societal views.\n\nThe MHCC must create a national mental health strategy, influencing research funding and provinces' priorities, and combat the stigma of mental illness. Despite revisions, the strategy's ideological balance is elusive. A spokesman said the draft is close to complete, focusing on “recovery,” suicide prevention, self-care, and ending restraint of psychiatric patients. Its focus on health promotion and workplaces has led to criticism that this is more about wellness than illness.\n\nHerschel Hardin, a critic, says the agency downplays the importance of treatment and relies on euphemisms, claiming recovery requires structure from others. Hardin believes the agency has not thoroughly considered important aspects, burying them in vague language. Vocabulary further complicates this debate, with terms like “survivors” or “consumers” used instead of patients, and lack of insight labeled as “anosognosia.”\n\nBill Honer, head of psychiatry at a university, warns this strategy could harm those unable to guide themselves to recovery due to their illness. He emphasizes that while societal labels and diagnoses impact perceptions, they are crucial in psychiatry. Ms. Bradley declined an interview, but strategic advisor Howard Chodos, who created the draft, states it was developed through meetings and surveys, with most participants supportive of the strategy's direction.\n\nMr. Chodos admits the draft's language needs improvement to connect with people and gain support. He rejects the idea that focusing on consensus ignores hard cases, believing a balance can be achieved without sacrificing either element.", "simplified3": "As Senator Roméo Dallaire launches Alberta's mental health initiative and Queen’s University starts its own mental health commission after several suicides, both will likely consider the challenges faced by the $130-million, 10-year Mental Health Commission of Canada project.. Since a draft of its national mental health strategy was leaked this summer, the agency has faced accusations of dysfunction, anti-psychiatry bias, and neglecting serious mental illnesses.. Critics note that the 30-page document frequently mentions \"recovery\" and \"support\" but omits terms like \"psychiatry,\" \"schizophrenia,\" or \"bipolar.\" Louise Bradley, the agency's CEO, pledged to revise the strategy to better include neuroscience, treatment, and psychiatry's roles. The MHCC aims to balance the mental health ideologies of empowerment-focused recovery and psychiatry-based treatment.. The core of this extreme ideological clash is whether mental illness is rooted in the brain or in societal stigma.. A key part of the MHCC's dual mandate is to create a national mental health strategy, influencing research funding and provincial health care and social policy priorities.. Its mandate also includes reducing mental illness stigma through outreach and advocacy, mainly targeting health-care providers, usually the first contact for the mentally ill with the government.. Despite the ongoing revision, the MHCC struggles to achieve ideological balance. A spokesman stated the draft strategy is nearly complete and remains fundamentally supported by the Commission. The draft emphasizes \"recovery,\" stressing suicide prevention, self-directed care, improvement over cure, and ending the seclusion and restraint of psychiatric patients.. Critics argue that its emphasis on health promotion and prevention, including employers' role in healthy workplaces, shifts the focus from mental illness to mental wellness.. \"They've misused the word 'recovery,'\" said Herschel Hardin, president of the North Shore Schizophrenia Society in B.C. His organization's latest bulletin accuses the commission of using positive-sounding language to obscure issues and claims that people knowledgeable about severe mental illness no longer take the MHCC seriously, viewing it instead as a threat. He added that the agency overemphasizes the idea that recovery cannot be externally imposed and must be achieved individually.. \"For the seriously ill, recovery after treatment is just a small part and requires both support and structure from others,\" he said.. \"At the MHCC, people have neglected their homework and hidden key considerations in bureaucratic language; vocabulary notably complicates this health debate.\". Patients are labeled as \"survivors,\" \"consumers,\" or \"experts by experience,\" while a schizophrenic's lack of insight is termed \"anosognosia.\". \"The concept of recovery in mental illness has a specific meaning that isn't clear to the general public,\" said Bill Honer, head of psychiatry at the University of British Columbia and schizophrenia expert.. It's not like cancer remission, where the disease retreats, or recovering from a cold, where it disappears completely.. According to the MHCC, mental health recovery is a way of life.. The risk, Prof. Honer said that requiring individuals to guide themselves to recovery might be unfair to those who can't understand their own illness.. He said, \"Strictly interpreting that strategy risks us not fulfilling our social responsibilities.\". There is widespread confusion about these words and their implications, he said.. While labeling and diagnosing are social constructs, they differ from our work in psychiatry.. A diagnosis is not bad.. That's how we operate.. \"Labeling and stigma exist; that's how society functions.\". Bradley declined an interview, but strategic advisor Howard Chodos, who drafted the strategy, said it was created through meetings and an online survey.. He stated that most consultation participants supported the strategy, but after the draft reached a broader audience, more public discussion was included. Not everyone was included.. \"We don't have the resources to do that right now,\" he added.. We were confident that the group's feedback would help us improve the document.. Chodos admitted the draft's language needs improvement to resonate and gain support but disagreed that the emphasis on consensus hides difficult issues.. \"I reject the idea that those two elements are fundamentally opposed,\" he said.. We can achieve a balance without sacrificing either side.."}
