    "Article":"The disgraced sports star is as combative as ever, but he's mostly given up cycling and spends a lot of his time on the golf course, sipping \"Lanceritas.\"\nIt's been 18 months since Lance Armstrong's poorly received TV confession to Oprah Winfrey of his repeated doping, lying and bullying of adversaries over the course of his epic cycling career.\nIn the latest issue of Esquire, John H. Richardson checks in with the disgraced athlete and cancer survivor for a lengthy interview. The piece, titled \"Lance Armstrong in Purgatory: The Afterlife\" reveals a downsized but still defiant Armstrong ego — a man adjusting to and still coping with his remarkable fall from the apex of athletics to widespread derision and infamy.\nPHOTOS Stars Behaving Badly: From Justin Bieber to Reese Witherspoon, Hollywood's Recent Mugshots\nHere are six of the most surprising revelations from the interview.\n1) He plays golf now and rarely cycles\nArmstrong reveals that he always hated golf, but now that he's essentially unemployed, he's taken to playing the game five times a week. Writes Richardson: \"The game isn't natural to him. You have to swivel your hips and his legs were all about up and down. Now he takes lessons, plays eighteen holes, then goes home to watch golf on TV. … Armstrong just shrugs. \"What else am I gonna do?\"\nMore striking, given his renowned training regimens during the glory days, he seldom cycles now.\n\"It's like, I don't really care,\" he says, a little mystified. \"It's weird.\"\n2) He regrets the lying and bullying, but remains defiant about doping\n\"To this day, in any forum available to him, Armstrong refuses to repent on the main charge against him. He seems sincere in his regret for lying so insistently and suing people who tried to expose him, but on the charge of doping he simply cannot form his lips around the pious apology the public expects.\"\nArmstrong insists he had a simple choice: He could either do what it took to win (cheat) or go back to work at a bike shop in Austin. He cites Michael Irvin, the Dallas Cowboys star receiver of the 1990s, as a sort of inspiration: \"I mean, he was getting busted with strippers and cocaine and shit. All the Cowboys, they were fucking nuts. And he had this one great line: 'I'm gonna catch a touchdown this weekend and it's all good.'\"\nPHOTOS World Cup: 13 Sexy Soccer Players Stretching\n3) He actually calls his margaritas 'Lanceritas'\nThroughout the series of interviews that make up the article, Armstrong orders, sips and whips up his signature \"Lanceritas.\" Richardson declines to supply the cyclists' signature recipe, although he appears to prefer lime and insists on crushed ice. Ordering a second round at a restaurant, Armstrong tells a waiter: \"Keep the same ice, bro. I love crushed ice.\"\n4) He gets eviscerated on Facebook even when he's doing something nice\nAlthough exiled from the influential charitable organization he self-financed and founded, Livestrong, Armstrong is still actively in touch with the cancer survivor community. He keeps his profile and communications mostly private now, however. When he does pop his head up publicly on social media, it tends to get bludgeoned.\nAfter a cancer victim Armstrong was close with passed away, he posted a small heartfelt Facebook tribute: \"RIP Jimmy Fowkes,\" it read. \"You have forever touched my life as well as millions of others. I will miss you. Jimmystrong….\"\nDespite the solemn subject, Armstrong was instantly blasted: \"I'll bet he didn't cheat,\" read one comment.\nPHOTOS World Cup 2014: Top 11 Shocks and Surprises of the Tournament\n5) His megalomania remains intact (at least occasionally)\nDid Nelson Mandela really forgive the people who put him in prison for 27 years, he asks at one point in the interview, or did he just say that for public consumption?\nHe also compares himself to Bill Clinton so many times he eventually concedes he shouldn't compare himself to Bill Clinton, since it might sound \"vainglorious.\" So he shifts gears and likens himself to other legendary sports stars. \"People are fine that Michael Jordan was a jerk, they're fine if Wayne Gretzky was a jerk, but they weren't fine with me being an asshole. They expected that perfect story.\"\n6) He still means a great deal to many cancer survivors\nThe article is peppered with anecdotes from cancer survivors about the personal video messages they received from Armstrong and the pivotal role he played in their recovery. Richardson's reporting also reveals that Armstrong has discreetly hosted a fundraiser for a camp for sick kids and hopes to reconcile with Livestrong. While open or combative on most issues, Armstrong seems to have acquired a new sense of discretion when it comes to discussing his activities in the cancer survivor community. \"He will not talk about any of this, because he considers it unseemly,\" Richardson writes.\n",

    "Article":"Two new NASA probes that are flying through the belts of radiation surrounding Earth have found that these regions change more rapidly than previously thought.\nThe Van Allen Probes — a pair of twin spacecraft formerly known as the Radiation Belt Storm Probes — launched Aug. 30, and turned on their instruments two days later. Since then, the spacecraft have returned unprecedented measurements of the zones of charged particles, called the Van Allen radiation belts, around our planet. In these zones, trillions of high-energy particles released by the sun are trapped by Earth's magnetic field.\n\"We've all been just amazed at the tremendous results that we've seen even at this early date,\" deputy project scientist Nikki Fox of Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory said Tuesday during a press conference at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.\nThe spacecraft have been orbiting less than 100 days, but have already sent back a wealth of data about these regions, which are difficult to measure, as the radiation there is damaging to most probes (the Van Allen vehicles are armored with thick aluminum shielding to protect their electronics). [ Gallery: NASA's Radiation Belt Storm Probes ]\nOne of the spacecrafts' findings is that conditions in the radiation belts change on a dime, with the particles there varying more in energy, in time and in spatial distribution than previously thought.\n\"What we're seeing is a much more dynamic, much more rapidly changing outer radiation belt than we expected to see,\" said Daniel Baker, principal investigator of the Van Allen Probes Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope instrument, who is the director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"We're seeing both spatial and temporal structure that we simply didn't know existed.\"\nThe spacecraft have also measured the choruses of sound, in the form of radio waves, coming from Earth's magnetosphere — a noise the scientists have likened to the sounds of \" alien birds.\"\n\"Not only do you hear the chirps, the alien birds, but you hear cricket-like sounds in the background,\" said Craig Kletzing, principal investigator of the Van Allen Probes Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science instrument, based at the University of Iowa. \"This is really a fantastic new measurement. … We've never had that level of detail before.\"\nAnd the insights provided by the Van Allen Probes are just getting started — the vehicles are slated for at least a two-year mission. Ultimately their findings will not just elucidate the science behind this part of Earth's environment, but could help protect future spacecraft from the damaging effects of the radiation there.\n\"The Van Allen Probes mission is really going to rewrite the books as to how to define and specify the Earth's environment before we launch\" new missions, said Joseph Mazur, principal investigator of the Van Allen Probes Relativistic Proton Spectrometer at the Aerospace Corporation in Chantilly, Va.\nFollow Clara Moskowitz on Twitter @ClaraMoskowitz or Space.com @Spacedotcom.

An expert from the Ministry of IT, requesting anonymity, explained the myths and realities of online earning to APP.

    "Article":"Implanted lens may improve vision without eyeglasses in some patients\nSilver Spring, Maryland—(ENEWSPF)—November 22, 2017\nBy: Stephanie Caccomo\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the RxSight Inc. Light Adjustable Lens and Light Delivery Device, the first medical device system that can make small adjustments to the artificial lens’ power after cataract surgery so that the patient will have better vision when not using glasses.\nCataracts are a common eye condition where the natural lens becomes clouded, impairing a patient’s vision. Following cataract surgery, during which the natural lens of the eye that has become cloudy is removed and replaced with an artificial lens (intraocular lens, or IOL), many patients have some minor residual refractive error requiring use of glasses or contact lenses. Refractive error, which is caused when the artificial lens does not focus properly, causes blurred vision.\n“Until now, refractive errors that are common following cataract surgery could only be corrected with glasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery,” said Malvina Eydelman, M.D., director of the Division of Ophthalmic, and Ear, Nose and Throat at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “This system provides a new option for certain patients that allows the physician to make small adjustments to the implanted lens during several in-office procedures after the initial surgery to improve visual acuity without glasses.”\nThe RxSight IOL is made of a unique material that reacts to UV light, which is delivered by the Light Delivery Device, 17-21 days after surgery. Patients receive three or four light treatments over a period of 1-2 weeks, each lasting about 40-150 seconds, depending upon the amount of adjustment needed. The patient must wear special eyeglasses for UV protection from the time of the cataract surgery to the end of the light treatments to protect the new lens from UV light in the environment.\nA clinical study of 600 patients was conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the RxSight Light Adjustable Lens and Light Delivery Device. Six months after the procedure, patients on average saw an improvement of about one additional line down the vision chart, for distance vision without glasses, compared to a conventional IOL. Six months after surgery, 75 percent also had a reduction in astigmatism.\nThe device is intended for patients who have astigmatism (in the cornea) before surgery and who do not have macular diseases.\nThe device should not be used in patients taking systemic medication that may increase sensitivity to UV light such as tetracycline, doxycycline, psoralens, amiodarone, phenothiazines, chloroquine, hydrochlorothiazide, hypercin, ketoprofen, piroxicam, lomefloxacin and methoxsalen. Treatment in patients taking such medications may lead to irreversible eye damage. The device is also contraindicated in cases where patients have a history of ocular herpes simplex virus.\nThe FDA approved the Vision Light Adjustable Lens and the Light Delivery Device to RxSight Inc.\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency is also responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\nSource: www.fda.gov\n",

This is the first device that can change the power of an artificial lens after cataract surgery to improve vision without glasses.\nCataracts are a common eye problem where the natural lens gets cloudy and affects vision. After cataract surgery, the cloudy lens is replaced with an artificial one, but many patients still need glasses or contacts because of small vision errors.

Such medicines include tetracycline, doxycycline, psoralens, and others. Using the device with these medicines could harm the eyes. It’s also not for people with herpes simplex virus in the eyes.\nThe FDA approved the Vision Light Adjustable Lens and Light Delivery Device for RxSight Inc.\nThe FDA works to keep people safe by checking that medicines, vaccines, and medical devices work and are secure.

    "Article":"AURORA | Aurora Public Schools was dinged by a statewide school-district rating system and will be in its fifth year of the “accountability clock,” according to data released Thursday by the Colorado State Board of Education.\nCherry Creek school district fared better but was scolded for low-participation in statewide standardized tests.\nThe state’s accountability system, created under the Education Accountability Act of 2009, assigns school districts a status based on academic achievement, growth and post-secondary and workforce readiness. APS was given the the second-lowest rating a school district can receive, the Accredited with Priority Improvement Plan. According to the official District Performance Framework report, APS is struggling most with academic achievement.\n“Over the past few years, we have implemented an aggressive reform strategy to improve our lowest-performing schools,” said APS Superintendent Rico Munn. “We are seeing these reforms take shape with many areas of growth and improvement, but we know that this growth is not happening fast enough. We will work to build on our momentum and continue to focus on our strategic plan to help every APS student shape a successful future.”\nIn November 2016, APS submitted a request to CDE to reconsider its rating and change it to Accredited with Improvement Plan, asking for Alternative Education Campuses, the New American School, Fletcher Elementary School and Aurora Central High School to be excluded from the data used to determine district performance. The request was denied.\nNearby Cherry Creek School District fared better than APS, earning the status of Accredited with Low Participation. Low participation was added to CCSD’s rating due to test participation rates below 95 percent in two or more content areas, most likely the result of students opting out of PARCC tests last year.\n“We are pleased that we continue to make progress toward our goal of Accredited with Distinction.

    "Article":"Talk about shop till you drop…Black Friday shoppers have nothing on the taxpayer-funded spending splurges by some rogue state agencies.\nNow that Governor Cuomo has unveiled his budget proposal for the state fiscal year beginning April 1st, the race is on for some state agencies and political leaders to not only deficit spend, but also quietly spend surplus taxpayer money before a new budget is passed.\nThey’re going shopping with your money, not necessarily because they have been authorized to by the Governor and Legislature or because the purchases are necessary, but at times solely because they may have extra cash in their coffers.\nOftentimes, a state agency will have a small amount of money left over at the end of the year and unilaterally go on a last minute spending binge.\nPretty soon this impulse spending adds up to big dollars. This irresponsible spending is even more concerning given New York’s crushing budget deficit which is projected to be up to $10 billion.\nWe’ve all heard the stories of needless, wasteful government expenditures: hammers and toilet seats that cost governments hundreds of dollars, and funding $400,000 “Ghost Ship” commissions that have outlived their missions, just to name a few.\nNowhere has the wild over-spending been more outrageous than in the recent revelations that the former Democratic Majority in the Senate spent at least $10 million over budget on posh office space while larding-up on staffing and political appointees.\nMeanwhile, as the State University of New York at Albany faces deep budget cuts, job losses and potential tuition hikes, the university handed out $1.2 million in so-called “discretionary” raises at the end of the year.\nThese two examples could be the tip of the iceberg.\nThe $136.5 billion New York State budget is really an amalgamation of hundreds if not thousands of smaller state agency budgets. Consider this: there are more than 70 state agencies, 64 colleges in the State University of New York system and 20 City University of New York campuses.\nThis is on top of the scores of public authorities that have little oversight by the legislature or executive branch. Each of these entities can be divided into smaller agencies, bureaus and departments each with their own little budget.\nThat’s a lot of hands in the proverbial taxpayer cookie jar.\nOftentimes state agencies fear that if they come in under-budget they’ll face steep cuts in funding for the following year. So instead of returning taxpayer dollars these agencies go on a shopping spree.\nState agencies that are fiscally responsible and spend only what they have been authorized to spend and not a penny more should be commended, not penalized. Unfortunately, what’s developed in state government is a culture of spend first and ask the question of need later. No wonder New York is as Governor Cuomo put it, “functionally bankrupt.”\nIn response to the wild spending sprees by state Senate Democrats and others, I am introducing the O.U.T. (Over-Expenditure\/Under-Expenditure\/Transfer-Notification) of Debt Act to prevent future taxpayer malfeasance.\nFor New York’s government it should be O.U.T. with end of the year spending binges. Too many agencies attempt to empty their coffers at the end of the year to justify their budgets. This is when deficits are created and expanded.\nMy legislation would require that all leftover funds are allocated to the general fund to pay down debt or reduce the tax burden on our citizens. If state agencies fail to comply, the Comptroller would be mandated to cancel any unapproved over-expenditures\/under-expenditures or transfers.\nA rogue state agency doesn’t need to waste taxpayer money on padding the payroll with political patronage or buying tens of thousands of extra paper clips just because there’s still cash in their account.\nIf it’s important enough to spend tax dollars at the last minute then it’s important enough to get authorization from the elected officials that actually pass the budget.\nThis is the taxpayers’ money and should be returned to help pay off state debt and reduce property taxes.\nThis bill won’t erase New York’s deficit on its own, but it will provide the kind of spending transparency the state needs to help get out of debt and save taxpayers from getting fleeced by end-of-year spending sprees.\n",

    "Article":"Former mob boss and fugitive James \"Whitey\" Bulger is seen in a booking mug photo released to Reuters on August 1, 2011. REUTERS\/U.S. Marshals Service\/U.S. Department of Justice\/Handout\n(Note: Paragraph 15 contains language that may offend some readers)\nBy Scott Malone\nBOSTON (Reuters) - For six weeks, James “Whitey” Bulger’s trial has played out like a movie. The longtime Boston mob boss has angrily cursed in open court, his own lawyer has described him as a mobster, and a potential witness turned up dead on the side of a road.\nAs prosecutors prepare to wrap up their case in the next few days and hand it over to the defense, the biggest question on observers’ minds is whether the 83-year-old defendant will raise the dramatic ante by taking the witness stand.\nBulger, whose story inspired the 2006 Academy Award-winning film “The Departed,” emerged as one of Boston’s most feared criminals in the 1970s and 80s. He ran a gang that prosecutors allege sold drugs, extorted bookies and murdered competitors, suspected informants and innocent bystanders.\n“There’s a significant likelihood of a fairly out-of-the-box experience, and that is Whitey using the opportunity to testify as his final moment in the sun and a chance for score-settling ... embarrassing old foes and old rivals,” said former federal prosecutor Mark Pearlstein, a partner in the Boston law firm McDermott Will & Emery.\nBulger, who has lost the shock of light-colored hair that earned him the nickname “Whitey” in his youth, has pleaded not guilty to all charges. But for decades, he has been notorious for his reign as head of South Boston’s Winter Hill gang.\nThose years of murder and mayhem have been on display during the trial, as witnesses described how the gang smuggled drugs and firearms, extorted a variety of people from bookies to business owners, and murdered rivals, suspected informants and innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire.\nOn Thursday, police said one of Bulger’s extortion victims, who had hoped to testify at the trial, had turned up dead. The body showed no signs of trauma but authorities are conducting an autopsy and doing toxicology tests.\nDefense attorneys often advise their clients not to take the stand. The risk of alienating the jury or causing jurors to doubt the honesty of the accused is said to outweigh any benefit of the defendant telling his side of the story.\nBut given Bulger’s reputation and after six weeks of testimony from dozens of witnesses ranging from former mob associates to relatives of murder victims, he may feel he has nothing to lose.\nBulger may also want a chance to publicly dispute the accusation that appears to bother him most: that he acted as an FBI informant.\nIn his opening statements, lead defense attorney J.W. Carney described Bulger as an extortionist, drug dealer and loan shark who ran an “unbelievably lucrative criminal enterprise.”\nWhat the defense has not acknowledged, and has spent much of its time trying to discredit, is that Bulger cooperated with the FBI, specifically corrupt agent John Connolly. The former agent is now serving a 40-year prison sentence on murder and racketeering convictions.\nBulger contends he paid Connolly for information but provided none of his own. The mob boss regards talking to the authorities, or being “a rat,” as the worst offense a gang member could commit. Prosecutors contend Bulger murdered several people he believed were talking to the FBI.\nOne of Bulger’s notable outbursts in the trial came when Connolly’s former FBI boss, John Morris, was on the stand describing a cozy relationship between Bulger and the bureau.\n“You’re a fucking liar,” Bulger shouted.\nTrial watchers point to outbursts like that as signs that Bulger believes he has little chance of beating charges that carry the possibility of life in prison.\n“I will be very surprised if ‘Whitey’ Bulger testifies,” said Thomas Peisch, a partner with Boston law firm Conn Kavanaugh and a former state prosecutor. “However, it does not appear that he has anything to lose and his ego may carry the day.”\nBulger fled Boston and eluded capture for 16 years after Connolly tipped him off in 1994 that arrest was imminent. He appeared on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted” list, but many in Boston thought he would never be found. Agents found him in June, 2011, living in a seaside apartment in Santa Monica, California.\nNow that he is back in the spotlight, Bulger may seek a last chance to beef up the myth of a straight-shooting mobster, who lived by a code of rough justice and silence.\n“If he does end up taking the stand, it’s because he knows it’s over and there might be some rough going, but he wants that wrestling match, he wants to shout back at the prosecutors,” said Richard Lehr, author of a book on Bulger titled “Black Mass” and a professor of journalism at Boston University.\n",

    "Article":"In Fracture, Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) is a cocky but likeable prosecutor on the rise. He’s about to go from being an assistant D.A. to joining a goliath corporate law firm — all chrome, glass and prestige. To top things off, his new beautiful boss Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike) has demonstrated an interest in taking him under her wing, in more ways than one. What could go wrong?\nOn the eve of his move, he agrees to take on one more case for the D.A.’s office. Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins), who we see spying on his cheating wife and then shooting her in the head, has signed a confession admitting to his crime. It should be an open and shut case, but the hotshot prosecutor with a 97 percent conviction rate soon finds himself mired in a trap set by the sociopathic Crawford.\nA courtroom revelation renders Crawford’s confession inadmissible, and Beachum soon discovers that they cannot find the gun used in the crime. “If you look closely enough,” Crawford says, taunting Beachum, “you can find that everything has a weak spot where it can break, sooner or later.” Unfortunately, Fracture suffers from too many weak spots, so\nIn spite of top-notch stars, Fracture abounds in flaws: The film drags, lacks an original story, and derives its main characters all too obviously from The Silence of the Lambs. In addition, moments that are supposed to be suspenseful — like when Beachum races to the hospital with a court-order to keep Crawford from pulling the plug on his comatose wife — are so badly paced that you forget what’s even going on.\nThe romance between Beachum and his new, seductive boss seems to come out of nowhere, and it doesn’t make sense that someone in as high a position as Nikki would jeopardize her job just to sleep with a new employee, however handsome. The film also stumbles during moments intended as comic relief, since the movie hasn’t done its job in setting the proper tone these moments were meant to disrupt.\nBut the biggest disappointment of Fracture involves what could have been a promising rapport between Gosling and Hopkins. Gosling is one of the few actors who can smirk and act cocky and still have you rooting for him; he plays it off as youthful exuberance. His elastic face is as expressive as a silent film star’s, and he has a magnetism that almost makes his boss’s seduction make sense.\nGosling deserves a better sparring partner than Hopkins, who seems to have simply walked from The Silence of the Lambs set without leaving character. Hopkins’ Hannibal Lecter shtick is getting old. His arsenal of sociopathic tics — the nostril flaring, the reptilian slow-lidded closing of the eyes — isn’t bordering on self-parody; it fully inhabits it.\nAlthough Fracture had promise, you just feel like you’re wandering around in familiar territory, none of it surprising or compelling.\nPhotos copyright 2007 New Line Cinema\n",

Also, exciting parts, like when Beachum rushes to the hospital, are too slow, so you lose interest.\n\nThe romance between Beachum and his new boss comes from nowhere, and it doesn't make sense that Nikki would risk her job just to be with a new employee. The movie also fails in funny moments because it doesn't prepare the right mood for them.\n\nThe biggest letdown in Fracture is the missed chance for a good connection between Gosling and Hopkins. Gosling can act cocky yet make you like him; his face is very expressive and draws you in. He makes his boss's interest seem almost believable.\n\nGosling needs a better co-star than Hopkins, who seems to act the same as in The Silence of the Lambs. Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter style is getting old. His odd behaviors, like flaring nostrils and slowly closing his eyes, are not close to self-mockery; they fully are.\n\nAlthough Fracture had potential, it feels too familiar and not exciting.

    "Article":"While Batman is arguably the world’s most popular superhero, his journey through Hollywood hasn’t always been a smooth one. The Caped Crusader’s first theatrical appearances date back to the 1940s, in the form of serials. His first feature-length adventure was 1966’s Batman: The Movie, an extension of the legendarily campy TV series starring Adam West and Burt Ward. Finally, in 1989, Tim Burton brought Batman to full blockbuster status, creating a stylized Gotham City with a dark, Gothic edge, and a Batman twisted enough to outright kill The Joker.\n1992’s Batman Returns mostly continued this success, and is today remembered nearly as well as its progenitor. Unfortunately, that’s where Joel Schumacher came in, taking over the reins of the Bat-series as director. While 1995’s Batman Forever has its fans, 1997’s Batman & Robin earned widespread derision, taking things to a level of silliness not seen since the West\/Ward days, and turning formidable villain Mr. Freeze into a laughingstock.\nThankfully for Bat-fans, then-rising director Christopher Nolan arrived to fix the franchise in 2005, granting Bruce Wayne’s cowled alter-ego the origin story he deserved in the form of Batman Begins. Presenting a more realistic take on Batman’s ascent to arch protector of Gotham, Batman Begins showcased the evolution of Bruce into the hero he would eventually become, and chronicled his training at the hands of Ra’s al Ghul’s League of Shadows. Now, years after covering Nolan’s follow-up efforts The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, Screen Junkies has given Batman Begins the Honest Trailers treatment. Check it out in full above.\nAs was the case when Honest Trailers tackled The Dark Knight, the series’ signature deep-voiced narrator does spend some time admitting that Batman Begins is a pretty damn good film. Still, that doesn’t stop Begins from receiving some of Honest Trailers’ signature humorous barbs, including highlighting the multiple criminal acts that Batman commits in the supposed name of justice, such as attempted murder, arson, and manslaughter. As the narrator points out, it’s still murder if you have a train do it.\nPerhaps the biggest target of the narrator’s mockery is the League of Shadows’ rather absurd master plan involving vaporizing Gotham’s water supply and causing mass chaos using The Scarecrow’s fear toxin, which is arguably just as ridiculously illogical as anything Cesar Romero’s Joker might have come up with in the ’60s. To be fair though, at least Ra’s isn’t going around cracking one-liners about how the ice age killed the dinosaurs.\nSource: Screen Junkies\nThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing\nAd Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!\nOver 10,000 Videos!

Today, that story gets more sordid in NBC’s follow-up, which shows that investigators suspected the same Ambassador of targeting minor children Meanwhile, the State Department calls allegations of obstruction and interference “preposterous”:\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\nThe alleged misconduct took place during former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s tenure, according to the documents, which also say those activities may not have been properly looked into. Top state department officials directed investigators to “cease the investigation” into the ambassador’s conduct, according to the memo. A state department spokesperson would not confirm the specific investigations, but told NBC News “the notion that we would not vigorously pursue criminal misconduct in a case, in any case, is preposterous.” Former State Department investigator Aurelia Fedenisn has said that investigators dropped the ball in the case, and that a final report published in March of this year was “watered down,” according to her attorney. “She felt it was important that Congress get this information,” Fedenisn’s lawyer Cary Schulman told NBC News.\nAnd this looks worse than it did yesterday:\nThe ambassador who came under investigation “routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children,” according to documents obtained by NBC News.\nThis ambassador got recalled to Washington for a meeting with Patrick Kennedy, Hillary Clinton’s right-hand man at Foggy Bottom. Instead of getting relieved and investigated, CBS reported yesterday that the man was “permitted to return to his post.” Did Kennedy make that decision? Or did Hillary Clinton?\nChuck Todd reports that Rep. Ed Royce, chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee, plans to open an investigation into this scandal. That should include subpoenas for Kennedy and Clinton, and we can see whether Clinton’s famous rejoinder to Senator Ron Johnson gets deployed again in her defense. It’s going to take a lot of explaining to convince anyone why the US sent a man to represent our nation whose own internal security suspected him of sneaking out to target minor children for sexual exploitation — and why these investigations got obstructed to the point where the IG had to blow the whistle to Congress.\nUpdate: The New York Post names names:\nA State Department whistleblower has accused high-ranking staff of a massive coverup — including keeping a lid on findings that members of then-Secretary Hillary Clinton’s security detail and the Belgian ambassador solicited prostitutes. A chief investigator for the agency’s inspector general wrote a memo outlining eight cases that were derailed by senior officials, including one instance of interference by Clinton’s chief of staff, Cheryl Mills.\nAnd the ambassador? The Post ID’s him as a big Obama bundler:\nA DS agent was called off a case against US Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman over claims that he solicited prostitutes, including minors. “The agent began his investigation and had determined that the ambassador routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children,” says the memo. “The ambassador’s protective detail and the embassy’s surveillance detection team . . . were well aware of the behavior.”\nGutman was a big bundler for Obama in 2008, raising over $500,000 for his campaign and cutting checks for the inaugural. That may not be terribly unusual for ambassadors in any administration, but the bizarre decision to keep Gutman in place certainly suggests a possible connection between his donations and State’s decision to cut off the investigation.\n",

    "Article":"Determina, which makes intrusion-prevention products, made an unofficial fix for the Microsoft Web browser available on Monday. The release came shortly after eEye Digital Security issued its own temporary patch.\nBoth fixes are meant to protect Windows PCs against cyberattacks that exploit a recently disclosed IE vulnerability Microsoft has yet to provide an update for. The software maker has not endorsed either fix, saying that as a rule it doesn't recommend installing outside patches.\nThis is the second time this year that somebody has beaten Microsoft to the punch with a security fix. Last time, security experts supported a patch issued by a European researcher. This time, they are not recommending people apply the unofficial fixes.\nInstead, people should follow Microsoft's advice and disable the Active Scripting feature in IE, or simply use a different Web browser, experts said.\n\"At this point, we do not recommend applying these temporary patches,\" said Johannes Ullrich, the chief research officer at the SANS Institute. Only those people who need to use Active Scripting in IE should consider adopting an unofficial solution, he said.\nThe vulnerability has to do with how Internet Explorer handles the \"createTextRange()\" tag in Web pages. Since the flaw was disclosed publicly last week, more than 200 Web sites have been found to exploit it. These sites typically install spyware, remote control software and Trojan horses on vulnerable PCs, according to security company Websense.\nAndreas Marx, an antivirus software specialist at the University of Magdeburg in Germany, said the security issue with IE is significant, but agreed that a third-party fix is not needed. \"I would not apply this patch personally,\" he said. \"As long as you're not using IE, you're safe. If you do use it, you should deactivate Active Scripting.\"\nActive Scripting, also known as ActiveX Scripting, is used to deliver \"feature-rich\" Web sites that can run small applications. Disabling the component in IE can have an impact on how well Web sites function in the browser.\nHeeding the expert advice, Susan Bradley, a network administrator at an accountancy firm in Fresno, Calif., said she is not deploying any unofficial patch. \"When any of these third-party patches are considered, one needs to think about supportability. It potentially puts me outside of support,\" she said.\nThe eEye and Determina patches block access to the vulnerable component in IE 5 and 6, the most used versions, to try to prevent malicious Web sites from taking advantage of the flaw. Both Determina, based in Redwood City, Calif., and eEye, of Aliso Viejo, Calif., sell intrusion-prevention products.\nMicrosoft has said it is working on a fix for the browser. That update is currently slated for delivery on April 11, Microsoft's regular monthly patch day. However, the Redmond, Wash., company has said it is considering an earlier release.\n",

    "Article":"This year's third annual craft-cider week in Ontario will include the grand opening of a bar that pays homage to the fruit-based alcoholic beverage by offering more than 80 different types of cider.\nThis ode to the fermented fruit drink – already popular in Britain – shows cider is clearly having its moment in the spotlight in Canada.\nCider started gaining momentum with Canadian drinkers several years ago and the growing taste for the beer alternative has prompted craft brewers and established beer giants to fight for a share of the profits. \"Similar to the way craft beer has carved out a niche for itself, I think craft cider has just as much, if not more, potential,\" said Joshua Mott, the son of craft-cider brewers who will open an establishment called Her Father's Cider Bar + Kitchen in Toronto in late May.\nStory continues below advertisement\nThomas Wilson, who grew up on his family's apple orchard and co-founded the Spirit Tree Estate Cidery in Caledon, Ont., in 2009, said he and his wife wanted to continue growing apples and turned to cider to add value and allow the business to run year-round.\nIn the years leading up to the launch, he studied the potential for selling the drink in Canada.\n\"We saw the beginning of the uptick in cider,\" said Mr. Wilson, chairman of the Ontario Craft Cider Association, a relatively new organization that now has 20 members as more people get into the business.\n\"The market is very hot right now,\" Mr. Wilson said. \"It's open to anyone that's there first.\"\nThe Ontario Craft Cider Association considers any locally owned, independent cider producer that brews up to 2.5 million litres annually for domestic consumption qualifies for the craft designation.\nAs the number of cider makers grows, so do the variations they concoct. The taste ranges from dry to sweet, and ciders tend to fall between 4 per cent and 8 per cent alcohol content.\nThis year's Great Lakes International Craft and Perry Competition in Grand Rapids, Mich., judged nearly 800 entrants in its commercial division – more than double the 300 competitors in 2013.\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nSales started to spike in 2013, according to Euromonitor International's report on cider trends in Canada.\nOverall cider sales jumped 20 per cent to $61-million at stores operated by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario in 2014 and '15, with sales of craft cider up 93 per cent.\nMike Lachelt, co-owner of Salt Spring Wild Cider on British Columbia's Salt Spring Island, said people choose to buy craft ciders partly because of increased interest in local products and because they may trust these companies more than bigger brands.\nBut it's not just small, craft cideries entering the competition. Major beer manufacturers are also launching cider brands as they search for ways to offset sagging beer sales, according to Euromonitor.\nMolson Coors Canada, for example, sells three ciders in Canada – Strongbow apple cider, Molson Canadian cider and the recently launched Wanderoot craft cider. They are only available in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.\nWanderoot is Molson's answer to the rising consumer taste for craft cider and is targeted at older, more discerning drinkers who love craft products, said Kristi Knowles, vice-president of insights, innovation and portfolio strategy.\nStory continues below advertisement\nThe company has been eyeing cider's potential for some time. Four years ago, it decided to work try to become the national market leader and, according to internal data, its ciders now account for about 23 per cent of market share, she said.\nMolson Coors Canada wants to grow that to more than 40 per cent over the next six years. Ms. Knowles said part of that strategy is getting more of its cider on draft in restaurants and bars, experimenting with new flavours and selling variety packs.\n\"We have our eyes open to what gaps we have in our portfolio going forward and how we might fill them,\" said Ms. Knowles, suggesting the company may launch more innovative products or purchase an existing product.

    "GPT_Result":"This year's third annual craft cider week in Ontario will include the grand opening of a bar that celebrates cider by offering more than 80 different types. \nThis tribute to the fermented fruit drink, already popular in Britain, shows cider is becoming popular in Canada. \nCider became popular with Canadian drinkers several years ago, and more people liking cider has pushed craft brewers and big beer companies to compete for money. \"Like how craft beer has made its own space, I think craft cider has just as much or more potential,\" said Joshua Mott, the son of craft cider brewers who will open Her Father's Cider Bar + Kitchen in Toronto in late May. \nThomas Wilson, who grew up on his family's apple orchard and started Spirit Tree Estate Cidery in Caledon, Ont., in 2009, said he and his wife wanted to keep growing apples and used cider to add value and let the business run all year. \nBefore they started, he studied the chances for selling cider in Canada. \n\"We saw the start of cider growing,\" said Mr. Wilson, chairman of the Ontario Craft Cider Association, a new group that now has 20 members as more people enter the business. \n\"The market is very popular right now,\" Mr. Wilson said. \"It's open to anyone who gets there first.\" \nThe Ontario Craft Cider Association says any local, independent cider producer that makes up to 2.5 million litres yearly for local people is called craft. \nAs more cider makers appear, so do the different kinds they create. The taste goes from dry to sweet, and ciders usually have between 4 per cent and 8 per cent alcohol content. \nThis year's Great Lakes International Craft and Perry Competition in Grand Rapids, Mich., judged nearly 800 entries in its commercial division – more than twice as many as the 300 competitors in 2013. \nSales started to grow in 2013, says Euromonitor International's report on cider trends in Canada. \nOverall cider sales jumped 20 per cent to $61-million at Liquor Control Board of Ontario stores in 2014 and '15, with craft cider sales up 93 per cent. \nMike Lachelt, co-owner of Salt Spring Wild Cider on British Columbia's Salt Spring Island, said people buy craft ciders because they like local products and might trust these companies more than bigger ones. \nBut it's not just small, craft cider makers in the competition; big beer companies are also starting cider brands as they try to make up for low beer sales, says Euromonitor. \nMolson Coors Canada, for example, sells three ciders in Canada – Strongbow apple cider, Molson Canadian cider, and the new Wanderoot craft cider. They are only sold in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. \nWanderoot is Molson's answer to the growing taste for craft cider and is aimed at older drinkers who love craft products, said Kristi Knowles, vice-president of insights, innovation, and portfolio strategy. \nThe company has been looking at cider's potential for a while. Four years ago, it decided to try to lead the national market, and according to its data, its ciders now take up about 23 per cent of market share, she said. \nMolson Coors Canada wants to reach more than 40 per cent over the next six years. Ms. Knowles said part of that plan involves getting more of its cider on draft in restaurants and bars, trying new flavours, and selling variety packs. \n\"We are looking at what gaps we have in our range and how we might fill them,\" said Ms. Knowles, suggesting the company might create more new products or buy an existing one. But Ms. Knowles said the company believes its three current offerings cover a wide range of consumer tastes and will keep investing in them heavily.",

    "Article":"The winsome Duchess of Cambridge and her princely groom, the Duke of Cambridge — known by commoners as Kate and Wills — have been making the public appearance rounds since their big fat royal wedding at Westminster Abbey on April 29.\nFirst, there was the meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama and his missus, Michelle Obama, which prompted a barrage of opinion on both sides of the pond about who won the fashion war of the two leading ladies. (Popular opinion had Kate taking the tiara, hands down, but for our money Michelle couldn’t get any classier.)\nAnd the flashbulbs were popping again this week, as the dashing couple attended a charity ball, all chic and coiffed and looking smartly regal.\nThat the newly crowned British royal couple has reignited a wave of monarchist emotion not seen since William’s late mom Diana hit the Buck House radar more than 30 years ago would be an understatement. They are fresh and young and educated and, by all accounts, in love. Mix in a palace, a designer wardrobe, a prince in uniform, a horse-drawn carriage and you have a made-for-Disney fairytale.\nBut something’s happening at the royal banquet table. It looks like the Duchess has forgotten to eat.\nThin may well be in her DNA — her mom and sis are athletic slim-jims, too — and she clearly tried to slim down in the months before the wedding, but recent post-honeymoon snapshots show that she seems to be shrinking by the day. Photos, for instance, like the ones that accompanied the couple’s latest official outing on Thursday at an London gala for a children’s charity show a Kate (pictured, with her prince) who is barely there.\nBarely there, and starting to get the unhealthy, gaunt look that so defines the look of a young woman who’s, well, starving.\nDoes it matter if the Duchess is so thin that her head is starting to look like the widest part of her body? It shouldn’t, but societal demands are such that women — especially women of profile, be they politicians, news anchors, movie stars or royalty — are pressured by constant messages everywhere they look that in order to be attractive and successful and accepted they must be thin. Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels, said waif-like model Kate Moss. I’ve never eaten a cookie, said rail-thin Spice Girl Victoria Beckham.\nIt’s the pressure and the expectation of achieving the coveted size 0, one can only surmise, that finds actress Angelina Jolie looking of late like a female Skeletor, so skinny that her legs look like twigs sticking out of her thick-soled pumps, Olive Oyl-style. And why pop singer Madonna’s arms are strips of sinew, and why reality show celebrities like the Kardashians talk non-stop about what diet works and why yoga is great for keeping a trim waist, and it’s why tabloids publish photo galleries of best and worst beach bodies, and whose cellulite is worse this year than last and why those kinds of cover stories sell by the millions.\nSomehow it’s not character that counts, but calories.\nBut, again, does it matter? Is it anybody’s business? Well, it wouldn’t be, except for the fact that so much has been made of willowy Middleton and her equally willowy sister and maid of honor, Pippa (who recently came in second in a British “Rear of the Year” contest), that one wonders if it isn’t all they think about when they climb out of the shower in the morning.\nIt matters because young people, girls especially, look to princesses and pop singers as their role models, rightly or wrongly. It matters because so many young girls and women today suffer from bulimia and anorexia and a skewed body image that has them binging and purging and eating fewer than 500 calories a day, subsisting not on food but on coffee and cigarettes and diuretics.\nIt matters because, right now, the light of the world is shining on the newly minted duchess. And whether she knows it or not, whether it’s fair or not, whether it’s acceptable or not to pitt her against a ridiculous societal standard, the 29-year-old is by all accounts one of the most-watched and (about to be) most-photographed celebrities on the planet.\nIt matters because she’s a princess, which makes her the modern-day poster girl for wannabe princesses everywhere.\nClick here for more photos of the royal couple at Thursday’s gala.\n",

    "Article":"<p>Early morning joggers pass each other on the Sydney Harbour waterfront near the city's central business district February 7, 2007. Moderate exercise like walking may be as good as or better than intense workouts when it comes to certain heart health measures, new research suggests.\nNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Moderate exercise like walking may be as good as or better than intense workouts when it comes to certain heart health measures, new research suggests.\nIn a study of 240 overweight, middle-aged adults, researchers found that moderate exercise, but not vigorous activity, improved participants' levels of blood fats called triglycerides.\nMeanwhile, improvements in \"good\" HDL cholesterol seemed to depend on how much study participants exercised, and not how intensely. What's more, researchers found, both benefits were sustained when exercisers took a vacation from working out.\nAll of this is good news for sedentary people who would find it hard to leap from the couch to a daily run, according to the study authors.\nOn the other hand, there's bad news for sedentary people who would prefer to stay that way. In this study, participants who remained inactive saw their \"bad\" LDL cholesterol levels climb over just six months.\nThe negative effects don't stop there. Previous work with the same study group found that inactive participants continued to gain weight and inches around the waistline, lead study author Dr. Cris A. Slentz told Reuters Health.\n\"In overweight or mildly obese sedentary individuals, continuing to be inactive is worse than previously thought,\" said Slentz, an exercise physiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.\nHe and his colleagues report the findings in the Journal of Applied Physiology.\nThe study included 240 overweight, sedentary men and women who were randomly assigned to one of four groups. In two groups, participants worked out intensely on treadmills or other gym equipment, but the amount of exercise varied; one group got the equivalent of 20 miles of jogging per week, while the other logged the equivalent of 12 miles.\nA third group exercised at a moderate intensity for a moderate amount of time -- the equivalent of 12 miles of walking per week. The fourth group remained inactive.\nThe researchers then looked at the effects each regimen had on participants' cholesterol and triglyceride levels over six months -- and whether any improvements were sustained after the exercisers took two weeks off.\nOn average, they found, only the moderate exercisers showed lasting improvements in their triglycerides. Lasting improvements in HDL levels were seen only in exercisers who worked out intensely for a greater amount of time.\nThe same HDL advantage was not seen among people who exercised vigorously for a lesser amount of time per week. So, Slentz explained, he and his colleagues attribute the benefit to the amount of exercise, and not the intensity.\nThe bottom line, according to Slentz, is that \"most all of the benefits\" of exercise are related to the amount, rather than the intensity. An exception is that vigorous exercise, like jogging, is more effective at boosting cardiovascular fitness -- which, Slentz noted, may or may not be important in heart disease risk.\nSo a person's choice of exercise should depend on his or her goals, according to the researchers. For many people, that will mean moderate activity.\nThe \"wonderful thing\" about such exercise, Slentz said, is that people need only find a couple of 15-minute blocks of time each day to take a walk.\nSOURCE: Journal of Applied Physiology, August 2007.\n",

    "GPT_Result":"Early morning joggers run past each other on the Sydney Harbour waterfront near the city center on February 7, 2007. New research says moderate exercise like walking can be as good or better than intense workouts for some heart health parts. NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Moderate exercise like walking might be as good or better than hard workouts for certain heart health parts, new research shows. In a study of 240 overweight, middle-aged adults, researchers found that moderate exercise, but not hard activity, made blood fats called triglycerides better in the participants. Also, improvements in \"good\" HDL cholesterol depended on how much people in the study exercised, not how hard. Researchers also found that these benefits stayed even when people stopped exercising for a while. This is good news for people who sit a lot and find it hard to start running every day, say the study authors. However, there is bad news for people who sit a lot and want to stay that way. In the study, people who stayed inactive saw their \"bad\" LDL cholesterol levels go up after just six months. The bad effects don't end there. Past work with the same study group showed that people who did not move continued to gain weight and inches around the waist, the head study author Dr. Cris A. Slentz told Reuters Health. \"In overweight or mildly obese people who do not move, staying inactive is worse than we thought,\" said Slentz, an exercise expert at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. He and his team share the findings in the Journal of Applied Physiology. The study involved 240 overweight, inactive men and women who were randomly put into four groups. In two groups, people did tough workouts on treadmills or gym machines, but the time spent was different; one group did 20 miles of jogging each week, while the other did 12 miles. A third group did moderate exercise for a medium amount of time -- like walking 12 miles each week. The fourth group did not move. The researchers then checked how each exercise plan changed participants' cholesterol and triglyceride levels over six months and if the improvements stayed after exercisers took two weeks off. On average, they found that only people who did moderate exercise had lasting improvements in their triglycerides. Long-lasting improvements in HDL levels were seen only in people who exercised hard for a longer time. The same HDL benefit was not seen in people who did tough exercise for a shorter time each week. So, Slentz said he and his team believe the benefit is because of the amount of exercise, not the effort level. Slentz says the key point is that \"almost all benefits\" of exercise are connected to the amount, not the effort level. An exception is that tough exercise, like jogging, is better at improving heart fitness -- which, Slentz noted, might or might not matter for heart disease risk. So a person's choice of exercise should depend on their goals, according to the researchers. For many people, that will mean moderate activity. The \"great thing\" about such exercise, Slentz said, is people only need two 15-minute times each day to take a walk. SOURCE: Journal of Applied Physiology, August 2007.",

    "Article":"The European Ombudsman will today (14 February) launch a formal investigation into allegations that the European Commission is failing to clamp down on conflicts of interest amongst staff who leave the EU executive to take up jobs as lobbyists and consultants.\nAn original complaint was filed to the Ombudsman in October last year by NGOs Corporate Europe Observatory, Greenpeace, Lobbycontrol and Spinwatch, claiming that the Commission is unwittingly allowing private interests undue influence in public policymaking.\nThe Ombudsman is due to launch a formal investigation, and will seek previously undisclosed details of all cases in the last three years where Commission staff have left to take up jobs in the private sector where conflicts may occur.\nCommission has power to ban and impose conditions\nUnder current rules, staff leaving the EU executive should be vetted for conflicts of interest before taking up private-sector jobs, and monitored for two years afterwards where such positions could lead to a conflict with the “legitimate interests of the institution”.\nIf such a potential conflict is uncovered then the EU executive has the power to ban the move, or impose conditions on it.\nThe original complaint set out 10 examples of perceived abuses of the revolving-door system. These included the cases of John Bruton, the former EU ambassador to the United States and Petra Ehrler, the head of cabinet to the former Enterprise and Industry Commissioner, Günther Verheugen.\nThe document said that Bruton, who went on to become a senior advisor to Brussels-based lobby consultancy Cabinet DN, failed to inform the Commission of his move and later said he did not know he was supposed to.\nEhrler set up an EU lobby consultancy with Verheugen immediately after leaving her post, but only applied for permission to do so four months later, claiming that she had not been made aware of this requirement, according to the complaint.\nOmbudsman could recommend stricter rules\n“If there are indications of a systemic problem, I will close the inquiry into the present complaint and open an own-initiatives inquiry, thereby giving me greater procedural flexibility to pursue my inquiry in the public interest,” the Ombudsman told the complainants in correspondence dated 1 February.\nAfter the investigation, the Ombudsman could make recommendations as to how the Commission carries out its duties.\n“Dalligate has shown us that personal contacts in the Commission are extremely useful to lobbyists wishing to promote their interests,” said Rachel Tansey, a campaigner with Corporate Europe Observatory.\nTansey was referring to the case of the former health commissioner, John Dalli, who was forced to resign last year amid allegations that he was influenced by lobbyists.\n“Many lobby consultancies head hunt Commission staff because they provide them with invaluable inside knowledge and contacts. It is a profitable business strategy and one the Commission cannot afford to ignore,” Tawnsey added.\nThe NGOs are calling on the Commission and the European Parliament to require lobby groups, companies and consultancies signed up to the EU’s transparency register to disclose if their lobbyists have previously worked as EU officials.\nThe EU register is currently under review, two years after it was launched.\n",

Simons had replaced John Galliano after he was sacked amid controversy in 2011.\nDIOR’S PARISIENNE\nUS Vogue fashion doyenne Anna Wintour, former French first lady Bernadette Chirac and Chinese actress Liu Yifei were among celebrities on the pared-down front row of the show held in an annex inside the picturesque Rodin Museum gardens.\nIn the clothes, the “spontaneous, relaxed Parisienne of today” mixed with the iconic styles of the 1940s and 1950s.\nHigh-cut post-War shoes with occasional retro ankle bows accessorized embroidered silk gowns in freestyle volumes — often with “sensual, bare” accentuated shoulders. A couple of flapper-style lace, chiffon and tulle look also evoked the joyful feeling of the 1920s — the period between the two World Wars.\nThe studio team also set about experimenting with the famed “bar jacket” — it “changes appearance depending on whether it is worn closed or loose,” said the program notes.\nIt thus came in myriad forms: in tight, embroidered black wool, loose and white, open to expose the breast sensually, oversized and masculine, or as a beautiful dark navy wool coat.\nThere were also traces of the historical musings of past creative directors — such as Galliano and Simons — set off nicely in one look off-white wool “bar” jacket interpretation with flappy 18th-century cuffs.\nSCHIAPARELLI’S GASTRO-COUTURE\nActress Bosworth — who sported an elegant chignon — hit the Schiaparelli front row on Monday, taking her seat next to pop singer, model, and former French First Lady Carla Bruni — distracting some by talking on her cellphone.\nIn the collection, designer Bertrand Guyon continued to explore the fascinating universe of couturier Elsa Schiaparelli in his sophomore outing for the house.\nOn the creative menu at the Monday morning show was fashion gastronomy.\nIt was an interesting way showcase the eccentricity of the vivacious “Schiap,” as she was known, who loved eating well.\nCrockery lined the walls of the show venue, as daywear looks inspired by the table — such as botanical diagrams and vegetable prints — opened the show on light, sporty skirt suits.\nAt times, it worked well — but occasionally the ideas translated too obviously, like one cream floorlength gown based on a red striped table cloth motif with plates on it.\nThe collection experienced a crescendo however as the looks moved into the evening.\nBy then, fashionistas could almost hear their stomachs rumbling.\nRALPH & RUSSO’S STAR POWER\nProving there are serious contenders in the couture calendar, relative newcomers Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo are drawing the big names to their collections. Pulp Fiction star Thurman set off the cameras naps arriving in a LBD and silk shawl at the Monday afternoon show.\nThe youthful-looking 45-year-old is in the City of Light to attend a private dinner hosted by the couture house and by French jewelry brand Chopoard.\nThe house say the event will be “celebrating the finest savoir-faire” of couture — and will include a musical performance by Ora.\nVALLI CHANNELS 60S AND EMPIRE LINES\nA strong ’60s influence infused Giambattista Valli’s vision for spring — as ever, served up in a long line of cocktail dresses and floor length gowns.\nA silk jacquard cocktail dress in two-tone grey sported a tight retro bodice and A-line mini.\nAnother silk crepe dress with delicate embroidered flowers had voluminous organza ruffles at the sleeve that evoked the silhouette of a bolero jacket, also popular in that era.\nAs the looks progressed, the dresses got more structural — riffing off the Empire Line silhouette, in one instance on a dress in printed lily of the valley with a tight, embroidered paillette bustier.\nThe floor-sweeping draped silk mousseline dresses at the end of the collection also evoked the delicate Romanticism of this early 19th-century style.\n",

    "Article":"A long-awaited State Department environmental assessment found that the Keystone XL pipeline is unlikely to have a “substantial impact” on developing the western Canada tar sands, a conclusion that rejects opponents’ claims that the project would dramatically increase greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe department released the supplemental draft environmental statement evaluating a new route for the pipeline that would skirt an ecologically sensitive region of Nebraska. While the project made no recommendation on how to proceed, it did not signal any significant environmental obstacles to the project, which is designed to transport crude oil from western Canada to Gulf Coast refineries.\nThe department is reviewing the proposal in preparation for making a recommendation to President Barack Obama, who has the final say on whether to approve the project.\nThe finding that the project would not significantly increase emissions that contribute to global warming is a major setback to environmentalists, who had insisted on a “lifecycle” evaluation of the impact on greenhouse gas emissions from extraction until burning.\n“With this preliminary analysis, we find in this draft that the approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, including this proposed project, really remains unlikely to significantly impact the rate of development of the oil sands, or the continued demand for heavy oil in the U.S.,” Kerri-Ann Jones, assistant secretary for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs, told reporters.\nEnvironmentalists expressed outrage at the finding, which Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune described as “deeply flawed.”\n“We’re mystified as to how the State Department can acknowledge the negative effects of the Earth’s dirtiest oil on our climate but at the same time claim that the proposed pipeline will ‘not likely result in significant adverse environmental effects,’ ” Brune said, expressing dismay that an agency headed by Secretary of State John Kerry, who was a leading champion of efforts to stem greenhouse gas emissions when he served in the Senate, could produce the report. “Whether this failure was willful or accidental, this report is nothing short of malpractice.”\nBill McKibben, founder of the grass-roots climate change movement 350.org, said the State Department’s analysis was comparable to what he described as its failure to anticipate the Arab Spring.\nHe called it “really sad” that the concerns of opponents who were committed enough to go to jail in protest, as well as those of leading scientists, were “just blankly dismissed by just a reiteration of the same tired boilerplate.”\nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer said she would review the impact statement closely.\n“I continue to be very concerned about the contribution that the Keystone XL pipeline would make to dangerous climate change,” Boxer said.\nSupporters Heartened\nBut supporters of the project seized on the findings to urge expedited approval of the project.\n“It is time to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which has undergone more than four years of the most exhaustive environmental scrutiny of any pipeline in U.S. history,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “An ‘all of the above’ energy strategy starts with signing off on Keystone and the tens of thousands of American jobs that come with it, which the president could do with the simple stroke of a pen.”\nIndustry groups also had a positive reaction to the preliminary review.\nChip Yost, the vice president of energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, called the study a “step in the right direction toward final approval of this important project.”\n“Americans are frustrated with Washington’s inaction, and Keystone XL is a prime example of inexcusable bureaucracy and red tape,” he said. “It’s time for the administration to expeditiously complete its review and approve the pipeline to put Americans back to work.”\nObama had previously rejected an application by pipeline builder TransCanada, citing concerns about the original route through Nebraska’s ecologically sensitive Sand Hills region. But the president invited TransCanada to submit a new application once it had mapped out an alternative route for the pipeline, and the company filed a new application last May rerouting the pipeline around the Sand Hills.\nEnvironmentalists have argued that increasing production of the heavy tar sands oil — which requires far more energy than conventional oil to extract, transport and refine — would dramatically increase carbon pollution. A Congressional Research Service report last May found that building the pipeline could cause an increase in annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to putting 588,000 to 4 million more passenger cars on the road.\nBut the State Department review found that denying the pipeline would not “significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the U.S.” If the project were denied and other pipeline and rail transport projects move forward, the decrease in production of the crude oil from not building Keystone would have little impact on emissions, the study found.\n“Fundamental changes to the world crude oil market” would be needed to “significantly impact the rate of production in the oil sands.”\nThe draft review’s publication in the Federal Register will launch a 45-day comment period, which will include a public meeting in Nebraska, according to the State Department. After the study is finalized, the department will lead an interagency effort to determine whether the project is in the national interest.\nThe ultimate decision rests with the president.\nThe State Department says it won’t make a final decision on the pipeline until the second quarter of the year. Originally, it had said it expected a decision within the first quarter of 2013.\n",

    "GPT_Result":"A long-awaited report from the State Department found that the Keystone XL pipeline is unlikely to greatly affect the development of the western Canada tar sands. This conclusion disagrees with opponents who said the project would increase greenhouse gas emissions a lot. The department released a new environmental report to look at a new route for the pipeline that would avoid a sensitive area in Nebraska. While the report did not give a recommendation on what to do next, it did not find major environmental problems for the project. The project aims to move crude oil from western Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. The department is studying the proposal to give advice to President Barack Obama, who will decide if the project can go ahead. The finding that the project would not greatly increase emissions that cause global warming is a big setback for environmentalists. They had wanted a full review of greenhouse gas impacts from getting and burning the fuel.\n\n\"With this early review, we find that approving or denying any one oil transport project, like this one, likely won't change how fast the oil sands are developed or how much heavy oil is needed in the U.S.,\" said Kerri-Ann Jones, an assistant secretary at the State Department. Environmentalists were very upset by this finding, which Michael Brune of the Sierra Club called \"very wrong.\" \"We don't understand how the State Department can see the bad effects of using this dirty oil on the climate but then say the pipeline will not cause major environmental harm,\" said Brune. He was surprised because the report came from an agency led by Secretary of State John Kerry, who had supported efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Senate. Bill McKibben, who started the climate change group 350.org, said the report was like the State Department not seeing the Arab Spring coming. He said it was \"really sad\" that the worries of opponents and scientists were ignored with \"old, repeated ideas.\"\n\nSenator Barbara Boxer said she would carefully look at the impact statement. \"I am still very worried about the dangerous climate change that the Keystone XL pipeline could cause,\" said Boxer. But people who support the project used the findings to push for faster approval of the pipeline. \"It's time to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which has had over four years of detailed environmental reviews,\" said Senator John Cornyn from Texas. He added that approving Keystone and the jobs it brings is important for energy plans. Industry groups were also happy with the early review. Chip Yost of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the study is a \"step in the right direction\" for the project's final approval. \"Americans are tired of Washington's delays, and Keystone XL shows the problem with too much government process,\" he said. \"It's time for the administration to quickly finish its review and approve the pipeline to create jobs.\"\n\nPresident Obama had turned down a previous application by TransCanada because of concerns about the original route through Nebraska's sensitive Sand Hills region. But he asked TransCanada to submit a new plan with a different route, and they did so last May. Environmentalists say getting and using the heavy tar sands oil uses a lot more energy than regular oil, which would greatly increase carbon pollution. A report last May from the Congressional Research Service said building the pipeline could increase greenhouse gas emissions as much as adding 588,000 to 4 million more cars. But the State Department review found that saying no to the pipeline would not really affect how fast the oil sands are developed or the heavy crude oil demand in the U.S. If the pipeline was denied and other projects moved forward, stopping Keystone would make little difference in emissions.\n\nBig changes in the world oil market would be needed to greatly slow down oil sands production. Publishing the draft review in the Federal Register will start a 45-day comment period and include a public meeting in Nebraska, says the State Department. After the study is finalized, the department will lead a government effort to decide if the project is good for the nation. The final decision is up to the president. The State Department says it will not make a final decision on the pipeline until the second quarter of the year. Earlier, it said it expected a decision in the first quarter of 2013.",

Kirkpatrick suggests if you can eat gluten, you should focus on a healthy diet overall.\n\n\"We must remember that eating more calories than you burn will make you gain weight,\" she said.\n\nYou can make a healthy diet by cutting out many low-nutrient, high-calorie foods that a gluten-free diet avoids. These include bread, pizza, cookies, and crackers.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

    "Article":"As Senator Roméo Dallaire, Canada’s best-known traumatized soldier, launches the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta’s Circle on Mental Health & Addiction and Queen’s University unveils its own mental health commission in response to a series of suicides, both may cast a cautionary eye on the travails of the Mental Health Commission of Canada, a 10-year, $130-million federal project.\nSince a draft of its national strategy on mental health was leaked this summer, the agency has been squirming under accusations of dysfunction, anti-psychiatry bias and neglect of the most serious mental illnesses.\nCritics point out the 30-page document mentions “recovery” 67 times and “support” 125 times, but there is no reference to “psychiatry.” Or “schizophrenia” or “bipolar.”\nIn a “letter to Canadians” last month, Louise Bradley, the agency’s chief executive, promised to “correct” the strategy before its planned release next year, because “the current draft does not sufficiently reflect the essential role neuroscience, treatment and psychiatry have to play.”\nIn doing so, the MHCC is trying to strike a balance between the two major ideologies of mental health: empowerment, based in social science, in which recovery is seen as a personal growth experience; and psychiatry, based in neuroscience, in which recovery sometimes must be imposed against a delusional will.\nAt its most extreme, this clash of ideologies turns on the question of whether the fundamental problem of mental illness lies in the brain itself, or in the stigma imposed by society.\nAt stake is a key part of the MHCC’s dual mandate — to develop a national strategy on mental health — which will influence the allocation of research funding and the priorities provinces set on this unique issue, spanning health care and social policy.\nThe other part of its mandate is to combat the stigma of mental illness through public outreach and professional advocacy, which have largely focused on health-care providers, often the first point of contact between the mentally ill and the government.\nAs the strategy gets revised, the ideological balance continues to elude the MHCC, although a spokesman said the flawed draft is “relatively close,” and the Commission stands by it “fundamentally.”\nFocused on “recovery,” the draft strategy highlights suicide prevention, self-directed care, improvement over cure, and calls for an end to the seclusion and restraint of psychiatric patients.\nHowever, its focus on health promotion and prevention, including the role of employers in creating healthy workplaces, has fuelled criticism that this is not a strategy about mental illness, but rather mental wellness.\n“They’ve stolen the word ‘recovery,’ ” said Herschel Hardin, president of the North Shore Schizophrenia Society in B.C., whose latest bulletin accuses the commission of hiding behind upbeat euphemisms and claims “those who understand severe mental illness no longer take [the MHCC] seriously — except to regard it as a menace.”\nHe said the agency exaggerates the notion recovery cannot be imposed by others and must be a self-directed personal achievement.\n“For the seriously ill, that’s a small part of recovery that comes after treatment for the illness itself, which is part of recovery, which requires a lot of not just support but structure, provided by others,” he said.\n“Here [at the MHCC] we have a bunch of people who really haven’t done the homework that they had to do, and buried the most important considerations in bureaucratic fluff and vague wording.”\nMore than most health issues, vocabulary clouds this debate.\nPatients are recast as “survivors,” “consumers,” or “experts by experience” on the one side, and a schizophrenic’s lack of insight medicalized into “anosognosia” on the other.\n“The idea of recovery in mental illness circles has a certain meaning that is not translated well for the general public,” said Bill Honer, head of the department of psychiatry at the University of British Columbia and a clinical expert on schizophrenia.\nIt is not like remission in cancer, in which the disease metaphorically retreats, or recovery from a cold, in which it disappears completely. Recovery in mental health, as the MHCC describes it, is an orientation, a way of life.\nThe danger, Prof. Honer said, is that a strategy in which individuals must guide themselves to recovery could be unfair to those who are unable to do so, because they cannot understand their own illness.\n“On a strict interpretation [of that strategy], we risk not fulfilling our social responsibilities,” he said.\nAt the same time, there is rampant confusion about these words and what they imply, he said. “The social constructs of labelling and diagnosis are real, but it’s not the same as what we do [in psychiatry]. Having a diagnosis is not a bad thing. That’s how we work. But labelling and stigma are, and that’s how society works.”\nMs. Bradley refused to be interviewed, but strategic advisor Howard Chodos, who prepared the draft strategy, said it was developed through face-to-face meetings and an online survey.\nThe “vast majority” of participants in consultations were “supportive of the overall thrust of the strategy,” he said, but the review process now includes “some of more public discussion that’s taken place once the draft reached a wider audience than we originally intended.”\n“Was everybody included? No. Did we have the resources to do that at this time? No,” he added.\n“But we felt confident that we would get the kind of feedback from that group that would enable us to strengthen the document.”\nMr. Chodos acknowledged the criticism and said the draft’s language “is not where we would like it to be, in terms of connecting with people, resonating with people in a way that will help to galvanize support for the document.”\nBut he rejects the notion that the focus on consensus obscures the hard cases.\n“What I don’t accept is that there is a fundamental opposition between those two elements,” he said.\n“We can find a way to have that balance, and we’re not sacrificing one on the altar of the other.”\nNational Post\njbrean@nationalpost.com\n",

This will guide research funding and set province goals.\n\nThey also work to reduce the stigma of mental illness, mainly focusing on healthcare providers.\n\nAs they change the strategy, the MHCC still struggles with balancing ideas, but a spokesman said the draft is “relatively close.”\n\nThe draft focuses on “recovery” and suggests stopping certain practices with patients, like seclusion.\n\nIt focuses on mental wellness, which some say is not the same as dealing with serious mental illness.\n\nHerschel Hardin from the North Shore Schizophrenia Society criticized the MHCC for using positive words to avoid hard truths.\n\nHe believes MHCC wrongly claims recovery cannot be led by others and must be done alone.\n\nHe says that for seriously ill people, recovery often needs outside help and structure.\n\nHe criticizes the MHCC for not focusing on the essential parts and using confusing language.\n\nThe language in the mental health field makes things complicated.\n\nPeople call patients \"survivors\" or \"experts by experience,\" while medical terms try to explain a lack of understanding about one's own illness.\n\nBill Honer, a mental health expert from the University of British Columbia, explained that \"recovery\" in mental health means a way of life, not like recovering from a disease or cold.\n\nProf. Honer warns that letting people find their own recovery path may not be fair to those who don't understand their illness.\n\nEmpowering words and their meanings sometimes cause confusion, he said.\n\nMs. Bradley refused to talk, but Howard Chodos, who made the draft, said it was created after many meetings and a survey.\n\nMost people supported the strategy’s general direction, but it now includes more public feedback due to the leaked draft.\n\nHe admitted they couldn't involve everyone, but they believe they will strengthen the document with feedback.\n\nMr. Chodos admitted the draft's language was not great for connecting with people.\n\nHe denied that focusing on consensus hides the hard issues.\n\nHe believes they can balance the two views without ignoring either one.",

While it may seem unfair to compare a gathering of the biggest machers in politics, philanthropy, finance, and the corporate world, to a scrappy little powwow of design startups and vegan caterers, there were some undeniable commonalities (like the attendance of folks from NBC and Coca-Cola). People in general, as they are at every conference, were far more interested in shmoozing and snagging as much free stuff as possible, getting onto the Wi-Fi and grabbing a power outlet, than they were in the sessions themselves. And more gravely, the ideas on the stage about how to make the world a better place, and in particular how to make big business more sustainable, were pretty played out.\nHeaven bless Jeff Swartz. Whether onstage or in a private interview the Timberland CEO tells it like it is. On a CGI panel with Walmart senior VP of sustainability Matt Kistler, and The Nature Conservancy’s lead scientist, M. Sanjayan, he burst out with, “The private sector is not the answer, because there is no answer. The\nabsence of leadership is the crisis–the government needs to do their\njob and set regulations … I’m getting old and tired of winning battles. I’m afraid of losing the war.”\nThat was on Tuesday. On Thursday I was sitting onstage–at a literal studio, the L.A. Center Studios–with Gopal Krishna, marketing VP from Coca-Cola, and three green entrepreneurs whose business models were perfect examples of winning battles with design. Worthy of special notice, Jason Foster has designed Replenish as a cradle-to-cradle cleaning company, with special spray bottles where you clip on refills of concentrate to the bottom; the stuff inside has all sorts of fantastic organic properties as well. But it’s still chemical cleaner in a plastic bottle that may or may not be recyclable or recycled in your local area.\nGopal Krishnan, a marketing VP from Coca-Cola, showed a little video to showcase their new PlantBottle (actually announced last May). “Up to” 30% of each bottle is made from PET derived from sugarcane byproducts. The animated video announced that the company is working toward “a goal” (no timeline) of “100% recyclable” bottles, although Krishnan made it clear in the panel that what that actually meant was 100% recycled bottles.\nBut it’s not, strictly speaking, true that Coca-Cola promotes 100% recycled bottles. While I was working on my story for the November issue of this magazine, Conrad MacKerron of the corporate social responsibility organization As You Sow told me that Coke, Pepsi, and other beverage companies spend lots of time and money fighting the mandatory deposit and takeback laws that are the single most effective measures determining whether containers actually get recycled. As a result, recycling rates in the United States have actually declined since the 1990s, from over 50% to less than 40%, while in the 11 states with deposits the rates average over 80%.\nWhat Coca-Cola is really after was also captured in the video.\n",

    "Article":"At least phone psychics have colorful personalities. The OECD has a new report out that blasts its own economists for having foggy crystal balls with regards to their recent forecasts. The Wall Street Journal reports:\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Tuesday said it underestimated the degree to which economic and banking setbacks in one country would have negative impacts on others, leading it to consistently forecast stronger growth than actually materialized in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. But in the latest analysis of forecasting failures by an international financial institution, the OECD said it didn’t share the International Monetary Fund’s view that misjudging the impact of budget cuts on growth was a crucial error. (Emphasis mine)\nThat last part is crucial because it entirely contradicts the progressive viewpoint. Since the recession happened, liberal economists, most notably Paul Krugman, have blamed nearly all of Europe’s economic problems on an underestimation of the damage caused by austerity, meaning budget cuts. They’ve reduced vastly complex economic systems to a single linear scale: more austerity bad, less austerity good. This is why half of Washington throws a four-alarm temper tantrum over seemingly microscopic budget cuts like sequestration. Only now, the OECD concedes that it didn’t underplay the role of European austerity in the wake of the financial crisis at all, but did underplay other factors, especially weak trade and flimsy banks. Also this:\nLarger forecast errors over 2007-12 have occurred in countries with more stringent pre-crisis labour and product market regulations (Figure 3). In part this may reflect the weight given at the time to pre-crisis evidence that tight regulations could help to cushion economic shocks (Duval 5 et al., 2007), together with insufficient attention being paid to the extent to which tighter regulations could delay necessary reallocations across sectors in the recovery phase. (Emphasis added.)\nIn other words, overregulation may have hampered economic growth. Imagine that!\nOver at the Washington Post, Robert Samuelson analyzes the OECD’s findings and concludes that it’s time to stop treating economists as technocratic soothsayers who can gaze into the data and predict the future. The problem is, there’s an entire cottage industry of pundits—many of whom used to work at the Post under Ezra Klein—who think charts, graphs, and studies can light the way into a great, big, beautiful tomorrow of government-guided prosperity. Naturally, Dean Baker, a progressive economist, yelps at Samuelson’s conclusion: “Yes, well we have to keep Robert Samuelson away from the really big numbers, he might hurt himself.” And they say economists can’t be clever!\nBaker’s only real objection, laid out in a comically unsubstantial blog post, is that Samuelson doesn’t mention the reduction in demand that resulted from the housing bubble collapse. Of course weak demand unquestionably played a role. But the point of the OECD evaluation is that, with regards to Europe, the economic establishment was in total error because it spent too much time on a simplistic demand-side scale (“Austerity!”) and not enough time accounting for other factors.\nThat error was probably inevitable. Economies are far too intricate to be encapsulated into digestible one-size-fits-all solutions. Helen Rittelmeyer recently wrote a brilliant piece for First Things that examined how intellectuals today have abandoned moral arguments in favor of coldly empirical ones. (Her article is pay-walled, but well worth the $1.99.) With egg on the face of the datamongers once again, maybe it’s time to put away the flowcharts and stop pretending the mirages of economists can solve all our problems.\n",

Also:\nBigger forecast mistakes from 2007-2012 occurred in countries with strict labor and market regulations before the crisis.

Fascinated by the concept of running human rights game based on a sprawling, mutli-platform gaming experience, America 2049's innovative blend of political drama and civic education attracted Hollywood types like Perrineau, Cherry Jones of 24, and Anthony Rapp of Rent to lend their visages to the project\n\"I try to be a bell ringer about peace and human rights, and I was really fascinated by the idea of an online game,\" says Perrineau, outlining his involvement in the project. \"The first year that I did LOST, JJ Abrams and Bryan Burk were really into gaming. They'd have me come over and they'd play these games for hours. I never really played games, but coming around I wondered how great would it be to be part of some massive, incredibly engaging game. I was fascinated with it at that point, and when Breakthrough told me that America 2049 would be a cross media, online game, the whole format sounded really interesting.\"\nAmerica 2049 is the first of its kind for a social justice game, an immersive online environment designed to utilize Facebook's dynamic network to bring users into a conversation about human rights.\n\"Breakthrough's mission is to find creative ways to tell stories about democracy and diversity and build bridges across constituencies, and identities,\" says Mallika Dutt, President and CEO of Breakthrough and longtime human rights activist. \"Media, arts and culture have been very important tools for us to engage people in constructive dialogue.\"\nFollowing in the footsteps earlier Breakthrough interactive campaigns ICED and Homeland Guantanamos, America 2049 drops the participants into the streets of Portland as an agent of the Council on American Heritage, navigating in a bleak future where the civil liberties we take for granted are distorted or non-existent. Through a series of challenges and puzzles in the hunt for Asaba, players are presented pieces of America's tumultuous history with civil liberties: a 1923 inspection card certifying that immigrants were vaccinated and disease-free, a poster protesting a ban on HIV-positive travelers lifted in 2010, and so on.\nDutt and Breakthrough multimedia director Heidi Boisvert were looking to engage players in a conversation about current tropes of social injustice in our contemporary society through the lens of a deeply immersive game.\n\"I think that games are an amazing oppurtunity to create microcosms of our social and political climate, think differently about problems, try on different identities, work collectively to problem solve, and enrich creative thinking,\" says Boisvert. \"People think of GTA [Grand Theft Auto] and other gaming environments as violent and sexist, but using the same mechanics we can encourage people to think and act differently in the public sphere. Gaming can be a space for trying on new behaviors. But Breakthrough never creates cultural tools. The game in and off itself is not supposed to transform hearts and minds, but there's always a curriculum, a call to take action. We create a virtual environment that extends to material cultural institutions, so the game is promontory.\"\n\"When we talk about human rights and social justice issues, there's a tendency for communities to have conversation within communities,\" added Dutt. \"It's important for us to engage a wider and more diverse audience. What is our country? What will our future look like? What will our nation look like moving forward into that future? Gaming allows us to bring in these wider, more diverse visions of American society into this conversation.\"\nFacebook, which connects nearly 600 million users around the globe and hosts massive social networking games like FarmVille (boasting more than 62 million users) and monopolizes nearly 68 hours per user per month, seems like the perfect platform to immediately reach a vast pool of potential players. While America 2049's primary gameplay takes place on Facebook, the fictional dystopia is spread over many online wikis and portals, from the Council on American Heritage's website to the Zooglio New Network, an imagined news wiki.\nWith a mere 20,000 active users and sparsely populated community wikis, America 2049 is far from a breakout success on the scale of games likes FarmVille, Mafia Wars, or any number of Facebook's procrastination tools. The gameplay on Facebook often proceeds in fits and starts, and despite the rich and intricate user interface, the political overtones are often heavy-handed, and the absence of civil liberties often seems rivaled by the absence of in-game player collaboration.\nBut despite the online game's few cosmetic shortcomings, the program's offline components -- educational events at cultural institutions -- suggest that the human rights issues raised by America 2049 are capturing the attention of players. An April immigration event at the Angel Island Immigration Station in San Francisco attracted more than 100 participants, while a packed forum on human trafficking at the Hull House in Chicago forced staffers to turn away potential attendees.\n\"We've seen an enormous increase in the number of people coming to our offline events as well as more interest in the themes pulled out through the game,\" says Dutt.\n",

    "GPT_Result":"In April, a Ugandan man ran away from a quarantine place in Portland, Oregon. People thought he had the Namibian Plague. Law enforcement officers are trying hard to find Asaba, but people in Portland are scared to say they know him. They are afraid they will be taken away from their families to the quarantine place he escaped from. The Council on American Heritage says Asaba is very dangerous and is not welcome in America. But Ken Asaba is not real. He is a made-up character voiced by Harold Perrineau from LOST in an online game called America 2049. Breakthrough, a global human rights group, made this game to teach players about social justice issues like immigration and racial discrimination. It uses a story about a future United States where life is controlled by strict and unfair rules. America 2049's new way of mixing political drama and learning brought in Hollywood actors like Perrineau to help with the game. \"I wanted to help with peace and human rights and liked the idea of an online game,\" says Perrineau about why he joined the project. \"When I worked on LOST, some people showed me games, and I thought it would be good to be part of an exciting game. When Breakthrough told me about America 2049, I found it very interesting.\" America 2049 is a first social justice game that uses Facebook's network to make people talk about human rights. \"Breakthrough wants to use creative ways to tell stories about democracy and diversity,\" says Mallika Dutt, who leads Breakthrough and works for human rights. \"Media and arts are important to get people talking.\" America 2049 puts players in future Portland as an agent trying to find Asaba in a world where some freedoms are lost. Players see different parts of US history with civil rights, like a 1923 immigrant card and a 2010 poster against a travel ban. Dutt and Heidi Boisvert wanted to make players think about today's social unfairness through a deep game. \"Games are a great way to show social and political issues, try new identities, and solve problems together,\" says Boisvert. \"People think of games like GTA as violent, but we can use game ideas to make people think differently. The game is part of a larger project to make people act and learn in real life too.\" \"We need to talk about human rights with more people, not just in closed groups,\" says Dutt. \"Games can bring new and different ideas about America into these talks.\" Facebook, with its many users and games like FarmVille, is a perfect place to reach many players. America 2049 plays mainly on Facebook but is also on other sites like fake news pages. America 2049 has only about 20,000 active users, not as big as FarmVille. The gameplay can be slow, and the political messages are strong, with little player cooperation. Even with some problems, the game's real-world events, like education meetings, show people are interested in the human rights issues. Over 100 people came to an immigration event in San Francisco, and many went to a human trafficking talk in Chicago. \"More people are coming to our real events, and they care about the game's topics,\" says Dutt.",

    "Article":"If you haven't been to a Ford dealer lately, you really owe it to yourself to test-drive the Fusion Sport before you buy your next car.\nThe mid-size sedan market is about as competitive as it gets in the automobile industry. These cars make up a huge chunk of every automaker's annual sales. But there are really two parts of the mid-size sedan market — the low-priced bargain leaders, and the more powerful and luxurious models at the top of the range.\nYou can buy a Ford Fusion for as little as $21,245, and you'll get a nice car for that money. But if you're willing and able to climb the price and trim ladder to the Ford Fusion Sport at $32,730, you'll find a truly special car waiting for you. The 2017 Fusion Sport can easily compete with the more expensive European and Asian brands on performance, build quality, tech and comfort.\nThe Fusion sport gets a 2.7-liter turbocharged V6 engine rated at 325 horsepower and 380 pound-feet of torque. Power is delivered to all four wheels through a crisp 6-speed automatic transmission. The Fusion feels solid on the road, with plenty of muscle under your foot.\nInside, the Fusion offers a comfortable luxury interior, with a dial-based gear selector on the console, similar to the design you'll find in a Jaguar. You also get heated suede and leather seats and a nice big touch screen infotainment interface with optional GPS navigation.\nThe Fusion Sport is also very quiet inside, in large part thanks to Ford's active noise control system. This system uses a microphone inside the cabin to monitor ambient road noise — the noise made by engine, tires, wind, and surrounding traffic. Then the car generates precisely \"opposite\" vibrations and plays them through the car stereo speakers. The noise and generated vibrations cancel each other out, with the result that you perceive the car as being very quiet.\nThe Fusion Sport has all the usual safety equipment you expect in a modern sedan, including rear-view camera, stability control, and a full basic safety suite. Optionally, you can get features like blind spot monitoring and automatic high beams.\nOne optional feature to mention is active park assist. With this feature, the Fusion Sport will automatically parallel or perpendicular park itself. You simply activate the feature, then drive forward until the car finds a spot big enough to fit into. Press the button and the car deftly swings into position. It takes some faith to let the Fusion park itself, but it works.\nIf you haven't been to a Ford dealer lately, you really owe it to yourself to test-drive the Fusion Sport before you buy your next car.\n2017 Ford Fusion Sport\nBase price: $21,245\nPrice as tested: $32,730\nType: Mid-size sedan\nEngine: 2.7-liter turbocharged V6 (325 hp, 380 lbs-ft)\nTransmission: 6-speed automatic\nEPA estimated mileage: 17\/26\nRoad Noise: Very quiet\nOverall length: 192 inches\nCurb weight: 3,681 pounds\nFinal assembly: Hermosillo, Mexico\n",

    "Article":"Kathleen Brooks\nTHE recent wobble in the financial markets highlights the fragile state of the economic recovery. One minute risky assets looked like they will perform strongly, and the next investors were rushing to safe-havens. What investors look for in this environment is a safe-haven asset with risk-like characteristics.\nPlatinum and palladium could be just the ticket. Firstly, they tend to perform well in both a risk-seeking and a risk- averse environment. Both metals act like safe-havens and tend to be bought by investors when there is a pullback in risk sentiment. But they are also used by the industrial sector, for example, in catalytic converters for cars, hard drives and for crowns that are used in dentistry.\nDue to this, supply factors can also weigh on platinum and palladium prices. Precious metal reserves have been falling in recent years, partly because production and exploration costs have risen rapidly, but also because fears about profitability, especially for palladium, has made investment opportunities less attractive.\nA shortage of supply is only problematic if there is enough demand to drive the price of the metal higher. And there are signs that demand for palladium and platinum will increase in the coming years, fuelled by growth in emerging markets. Consumers across Asia now want to own cars; in fact, auto sales in China surged past those in the US last year. And this could be just the tip of the iceberg as the middle classes, especially in China and India, continue to expand, boosting consumption in these countries.\nBut why should investors trade palladium and platinum instead of the more well-known precious metals like gold or silver? Julius Baer, the Swiss fund manager, recommends the lesser-known metals not only because they are regarded as safe-havens, but, because platinum and palladium have an industrial use, they are more than just “crisis metals”.\nInvestors might also be wary about entering into a long gold position when the price is currently more than 20 per cent higher than a year ago. In contrast, platinum and palladium prices have both underperformed gold and silver in recent years, with palladium remaining fairly flat.\nA long position in the metal can help the risk-reward ratio of a portfolio, according to Julius Baer. It argues that precious metals, including platinum and palladium, have low correlations to other asset classes. However, it recommends a long-term investment because precious metals can be very volatile in the short-term.\nBut for investors with little trading experience or knowledge of palladium or platinum, then an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a good way to test the water. An ETF takes away the hassle of buying the physical metal – such as checking its purity and storing it – since you can trade an ETF just like a share. Also, you can buy shares in an ETF in relatively small amounts, which is wise for a novice platinum and palladium trader.\nDeborah Fuhr, global head of ETF research for BlackRock, the asset manager, says that investors need to do their research if they are thinking about investing in an ETF.\nInvestors should find out what their chosen ETF is actually invested in, says Stephan Mueller, executive director of the Julius Baer Precious Metals Funds. Sometimes ETFs don’t hold the physical commodity; instead they own notes or certificates that are the equivalent of a claim on the metal, which is actually owned by a bank or another financial institution. “If you are invested in notes then this means that you have counterparty risk,” says Mueller. Thus, the ETF is not a true reflection of the safe-haven status of platinum and palladium.\nMueller would also avoid investing in ETFs with exposure to the miners of precious metals, since the sector is inherently risky: “Not only do you have geopolitical risk in the areas that resources are located, but you also have political risk and the threat that a government could nationalise your assets.”\nFor retail investors, it can be worth expanding your investment horizon to include palladium and platinum, along with traditional assets. But make sure you do your homework first.\n",

    "GPT_Result":"Kathleen Brooks\nThe recent changes in the financial markets show how delicate the economic recovery is. One moment, risky assets seem strong, and the next, investors move to safe places. Investors want an asset that is safe but also has some risk-like features.\nPlatinum and palladium might be good choices. They do well when people are looking for both safe and risky options. These metals act like safe places and are bought when people avoid risk. But they are also used in industry, for things like car parts, hard drives, and dental crowns.\nBecause of this, supply can affect platinum and palladium prices. Precious metal reserves have fallen in recent years because costs are high and people worry about profits, especially with palladium.\nA supply shortage is only a problem if there is enough demand to raise prices. There are signs that demand for these metals will grow, especially in emerging markets. More people in Asia want cars; last year, China sold more cars than the US.

Julius Baer, a Swiss fund manager, suggests these metals not just because they are safe, but also due to their industrial use, making them more than just \"crisis metals.\"\nInvestors might be careful about buying gold now since its price is over 20% higher than last year. Meanwhile, platinum and palladium have not done as well as gold and silver, with palladium prices being quite steady.\nJulius Baer says having these metals can improve the risk and reward balance in a portfolio. It notes that these metals don't often move in the same way as other assets. However, it advises a long-term view because these metals can change a lot in the short term.\nFor new investors in palladium or platinum, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) can be a good start. An ETF makes buying the metal simple without worrying about purity or storage, as you can trade it like a share. Also, you can buy small amounts of an ETF, which is smart for beginners.\nDeborah Fuhr from BlackRock says investors need to research if they want to invest in an ETF.\nStephan Mueller from Julius Baer advises finding out what an ETF invests in. Sometimes, ETFs don't hold the physical metal but own claims on the metal owned by banks, which has risk. So, an ETF might not fully show the safe nature of platinum and palladium.\nMueller would avoid ETFs involved with metal miners, as there are risks in that sector: \"Geopolitical risks exist in resources areas, plus political risks and the chance of assets being nationalized.\"\nFor retail investors, it may be good to add palladium and platinum to your investments with other traditional assets.

Why wasn’t this as easy as it was supposed to be? Unbeknownst to us, we had set ourselves up to fail by comparing ourselves so intimately to others. Every step along our intellectual journey had been marred by sad, sad comparisons to the abounding skills and experiences possessed by our untouchable acquaintances, classmates and friends.\nAll of this changed after Art. We made a few strange decisions in sequence: changing our intended major from Computer Science to Symbolic Systems; ranking high and ultimately moving into Kimball Hall, the arts-themed and transfer student dorm; enrolling in Art History 1B with well-known lecturer Alexander Nemerov. These all became instrumental in our self-development.\nSwitching our intended major before our initial decision had even made its way to official documents felt simple, but we now grappled with taking a burst of humanities classes that would perpetuate the pallor of our already weak computer science skills.\nLiving in Kimball Hall normalized our exposure to some niches that lived their lives in magnitudes of difference from us; fearless singers, bold painters, intimate writers, extemporaneous actors. Leaders, dreamers, creators. In being immersed with this crowd, we were forced to confront and contemplate their respective perspectives on life. They created from their hearts, from their souls, their guts. In this world where finally we could value introspection, the superfluousness of comparing our unique talents to others’ became obvious.\nNow living in Kimball, we sat down for Art History with professor Nemerov. On a superficial level, he looked like a “chill dude.” We had heard a wealth of good things about his skills as a lecturer, and thus we solidified our expectation: we were to be entertained. Instead, we were transformed. Art made up just the smallest portion of our working brain energy until this moment, when we became transfixed by the words Nemerov said and the ways in which he said them.\nNemerov spoke to us in our floor seat from his pedestal on the stage of Cubberley Auditorium, blasting puzzle pieces of knowledge at us. Jigsaw pieces that served not merely to inform us the factual stories behind phenomenal religious imagery and works of art, but also to acquaint ourselves with the thought processes of the greats. We realized that the greatest of the great didn’t let comparisons to others impede them from attaining their sacred personal goals, they simply believed in their thoughts, feelings and abilities of expression. From this, we found our confidence of self-expression and liberated our potential. With this realization came another, that the puzzle pieces Nemerov gave so freely were there for us to piece together our own masterpiece.\nWe have done amazing things in our lifetime, but the masterpiece has yet to come. In the past, mindlessly following the direction of the career expectations set for us by others and ourselves, we probably would have idly expected the arrival of this masterpiece. Now, we choose to forge it.\nI confidently believe, “All it takes is real belief in yourself as a person and hard work.”\nContact Coco Hergenroeder at codyhergenroeder ‘at’ stanford.edu.\n",

    "Article":"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nHowever, with so many projects in various stages of development and certain films being removed from the official DCEU release slate or pushed back - most notable being The Flash solo movie - it was unclear for sometime exactly how the DC-based cinematic universe would take shape. The studio announced a tentative DCEU release slate at Comic-Con International in San Diego this summer. Now, another film has been added to the growing list of in-development titles with Warner Bros. tapping a directing duo to shepherd a movie focusing on two of the most famous and beloved DC Comics villains.\nTHR is reporting that the studio is in final negotiations with Crazy, Stupid, Love filmmakers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa to write and direct a movie starring The Joker and Harley Quinn - with Suicide Squad actors Leto and Robbie to reprise their roles as the villains. According to the report, the movie will follow Suicide Squad 2 on the DCEU release slate, but since the sequel to David Ayer's villain team-up has yet to be given a release date - and doesn't have a director attached - it's unclear when this Joker and Harley Quinn movie will actually come about.\nScreen Rant previously reported that Warner Bros. was developing a Harley Quinn and Joker spinoff from Suicide Squad, with the tentative title of Harley Quinn vs The Joker. New information from THR indicates it will be a \"criminal love story\" focused on the titular villains; one source told THR it will be \"an insane and twisted love story. When Harry Met Sally on benzedrine.\" Additionally, THR reports Warner Bros. is fast-tracking Suicide Squad 2 as well as this Joker and Harley Quinn movie, so fans may get to see plenty of Leto's Clown Prince of Crime and Robbie's Maid of Mischief in the coming years.\nIn addition to Suicide Squad 2, both Robbie and Leto will appear in Gotham City Sirens. Previously, Gotham City Sirens was reported to be directed by Ayer, who reconfirmed his involvement last month, and is expected to include Catwoman and Poison Ivy, two infamous Batman villains who are part of the titular team in the Comics. Leto's involvement was only recently confirmed, in a report about the development of a solo Joker origin movie that won't take place in the DCEU. Instead, Warner Bros. is launching a new effort of live-action DC Comics adaptations that will be separate from their main superhero universe.\nBased on news of this Joker and Harley Quinn movie, it seems Warner Bros. is doubling down on popular characters already established within the DCEU movie. The Joker and Harley Quinn film would make four movies featuring the two villains, plus the studio announced Wonder Woman 2 at Comic-Con this summer - with the sequel set to hit theaters in 2019. For those hoping to see other DC Comics characters adapted for the big screen, plenty of standalone features are in the works, and the studio's new venture will pave the way for non-DCEU-related projects as well. In terms of the DCEU's future though, fans may be hoping Warner Bros. clears up some confusion concerning the upcoming slate with official announcements and release dates.\nSource: THR\nBond 25 To Receive Rewrite From Bourne Ultimatum Screenwriter\n",

    "Article":"While the rest of America celebrated the holidays by briefly escaping the workload that now, once again, dominates their lives, one unlucky group never got the chance to take a day off.\nI’m not talking about the beleaguered clerks at the Big Box stores that never seem to close, but, instead, those valiant defenders of virtue at the American Family Association (AFA). They were busy trying to stop elves from cavorting with a known lesbian.\nIn December, One Million Moms, the inexplicably angry online village founded by the AFA, inveighed against J.C. Penney for a holiday ad featuring spokeswoman Ellen DeGeneres.\n“JCP has made their choice to offend a huge majority of their customers again,” Moms said in a statement. “Christians must now vote with their wallets.”\nHyperbole is nothing new for the AFA satellite army. When Penney first hired DeGeneres last February, Moms blasted the retailer for “jumping on the pro-gay bandwagon.” Back then, the nasty broadside was wearying, though predictable.\nThis time, it was just stupid. In the holiday spot, DeGeneres talked gift-shopping with a trio of Santa’s elves. Scary, right?\nReasonable people can disregard the ramblings of a belligerent splinter group (as DeGeneres herself noted, you have to wonder about an organization that calls itself One Million Moms but can barely round up 50,000 Facebook followers). But I continue to be bewildered by the obsessive, mean-spirited activism of the American Family Association itself.\nSince its founding in 1977 by a Methodist pastor in Mississippi, the AFA (whose mission is to rid the nation of “ungodliness and depravity”) has sprayed its venomous indignation like buckshot, boycotting any group that bears the faintest whiff of gay inclusion.\nAmong its countless targets: the Walt Disney Co., for promoting “the homosexual agenda” by providing health coverage for employees in same-sex relationships; the American Girl doll company, for supporting the non-profit youth organization Girls Inc., which it called “a pro-abortion, pro-lesbian advocacy group.”\nAFA has also turned its sights on Hallmark, for offering same-sex wedding cards on its racks; the Ford Motor Co., for advertising in gay publications and sponsoring gay pride celebrations; Archie comic books, for allowing its first openly gay character to marry another man in one of its stories; McDonald’s, for joining the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce; and the Campbell Soup Co., for buying an ad in a gay magazine that featured a presumably lesbian couple and their son enjoying a bowl of butternut squash bisque.\nThese people must be exhausted.\nThough the AFA has largely gone after corporations that have the means to fight back, it crossed the line in late 2012 when it chose a new and more defenseless kind of victim: children.\nIn October, National Bullying Prevention Awareness Month, it launched an offensive against Mix it Up at Lunch Day, an 11-year-old national program that encourages kids to seek out new friends in the cafeteria as a way of keeping cliques—and bullying—at bay.\nThe AFA decried the program as “a nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools,” and it asked parents to file protests or keep their children home from school on that day.\nSupporters of AFA’s efforts argued that anti-bullying campaigns focus too heavily on protecting gay and questioning youths at the expense of non-gay bullying victims. But the fact is, numerous studies—including a survey by researchers at Harvard—have determined that gay kids are one to two times more likely to be bullied than straight kids, and between two to four times as likely to attempt suicide. It is a problem within a problem.\nThe AFA boycott was ultimately unsuccessful—only about 200 of the 2,500 participating schools reportedly canceled the day’s events—but it underscored the shameful irony at the heart of the brouhaha: that the American Family Association has now, in effect, become the nation’s reigning bully, preying on those who are different.\nOne would think that the AFA might learn a thing or two from the election season polls, which revealed that most citizens are turned off by negative attacks and, likewise, by those who would pry into their personal lives, including their sexual preferences. One would also think that the AFA might learn a lesson from last month’s tragedy in Newtown, Conn.: that our children are not only precious to us but also frighteningly vulnerable, and undeserving of being anyone’s prey.\nIt’s time to ask the AFA to stand down. Despite its self-appointed, McCarthy-like crusade to transform this nation into its own image, America doesn’t need its help, thank you.\nBruce Kluger contributes to Parenting, The Los Angeles Times, USA Today and National Public Radio.\nRelated Posts\n",

Furthermore, if a person takes the wrong dosage of anticoagulants, this can cause cardiovascular problems rather than help reduce them.\nWith this in mind, researchers from Qloudlab - a start-up company based in the microengineering laboratory of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland - have created a device that could allow patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy to self-monitor.\nHow does the device work?\nThe gadget consists of a small single-use film that is attached to the screen of a smartphone.

    "Article":"No one could blame Western Mustangs head coach Greg Marshall for feeling just a little lonely these days.\nThe 2018 U Sports coach of the year said the Mustangs headquarters at TD Stadium were feeling a bit empty in January with the departure of offensive coordinator Steve Snyder, who took over the Queen’s Gaels football program; offensive line coach Jean-Paul Circelli, the Windsor Lancers new head coach; recruitment coordinator Joe Circelli, who is following his older brother to Windsor as an offensive coordinator; and receivers coach and video coordinator Josh Malekzadeh, who is leaving the Mustangs to join his family’s construction business in Toronto.\nThe first couple of weeks of January, it was like ‘Oh my goodness. There’s no one here,’” Marshall said with a laugh.\nThe Mustangs, who made back-to-back Vanier Cup appearances, winning 39-17 over the Laval Rouge et Or in Hamilton in 2017 and falling 34-20 to Laval in November in Quebec City, are also losing special teams coordinator and linebackers coach Adrian Kaiser and defensive backs coach PJ Edgeworth.\nMarshall is interviewing candidates and he is confident he will find the right people to fill the coaching vacancies, although he is not planning to make any hasty decisions.\n“You have to look it as an opportunity,” he said. “It’s tough losing those coaches because they are good friends and good people, but at the same time it’s an opportunity for us to find someone else that’s young and wants to come in and work hard and learn what we do here.”\nMarshall is proud of all the coaches who are moving on and he said they will be difficult to replace.\n“That’s what we do at university right?” he said. “For our players this is a place where . . . they go to school and they learn all of the good things about football and teamwork and then they move on and they become doctors like Nick Vanin, or lawyers or pro football players. This isn’t a destination.”\nMarshall is not looking for coaches with specific specialties as much as he is looking for the best people to plug into roles he feels they will be most effective within the Mustangs system.\n“I know that coach (Paul) Gleason is here and he can do the defence and I know that I can do the offence,” Marshall said. “So, if the right offensive coordinator is available, as it was two years ago with coach (Steve) Snyder, who was willing to come in and learn our offence, then I would absolutely consider it, but I’m not just going to bring anyone in. It has to be a good fit.”\nMarshall said the loss that has had the most immediate day-to-day impact was Malekzadeh, who was one of the unsung heroes of the championship program, handling administration and video as well as his coaching duties.\n“He did everything for us,” Marshall said. “That was a big hit too because, really, that just left me here doing everything. It was like I did when I was just starting out coaching 30 years ago.”\nKaiser and Edgeworth, both teachers, are great coaches and role models for the players and will be missed, Marshall said.\nEdgeworth, who was a part-time assistant for 15 years, and Kaiser are leaving the Mustangs to spend more time with their families.\nWith Circelli at Windsor, Snyder at Queen’s, Chris Bertoia at Waterloo and former Western star quarterback Michael Faulds heading the Laurier football program, the Mustangs are making quite an impact on Ontario university football, but it’s not just the Western program that’s helped nurture such head coaching talent.\nCircelli coached the Catholic Central Crusaders, London Beefeaters and London Junior Mustangs, winning back-to-back Ontario Provincial Football League titles and Snyder was also a coach with the Aquinas Flames and Junior Mustangs.\nBertoia, a former Mustangs offensive line coach and recruiting coordinator, also coached the Junior Mustangs and Beefeaters. He was also an offensive line coach at Catholic Central secondary school.\nLondon’s powerhouse high school and minor football programs are a prime source for potential coaching talent for the Mustangs.\n“We have some of the best high school football in the country here,” Marshall said. “We have an outstanding minor system.

    "GPT_Result":"No one could blame Western Mustangs head coach Greg Marshall for feeling a bit lonely these days.  \nThe 2018 U Sports coach of the year said the Mustangs headquarters at TD Stadium felt empty in January. This was because offensive coordinator Steve Snyder left for Queen’s Gaels, offensive line coach Jean-Paul Circelli became Windsor Lancers head coach, recruitment coordinator Joe Circelli followed his brother to Windsor, and receivers coach and video coordinator Josh Malekzadeh went to his family’s business in Toronto.  \n\"The first couple of weeks of January, it was like ‘Oh my goodness. There’s no one here,’” Marshall said with a laugh.  \nThe Mustangs, who played in two Vanier Cups, winning in 2017 and losing in 2018, are also losing special teams coordinator and linebackers coach Adrian Kaiser and defensive backs coach PJ Edgeworth.  \nMarshall is interviewing new candidates and is confident he will find the right people, though he is not making any quick decisions.  \n“You have to look at it as an opportunity,” he said. “It’s tough losing those coaches because they are good friends and good people, but it’s also a chance for us to get someone young who wants to work hard and learn what we do here.”  \nMarshall is proud of the coaches who are leaving and said they will be hard to replace.  \n“That’s what we do at university, right?” he said. “For our players, this is where they learn about football and teamwork. Then they move on and become doctors like Nick Vanin, or lawyers, or pro football players. This isn’t a final destination.”  \nMarshall is not looking for coaches with specific skills, but rather the best people for roles in the Mustangs system.  \n“I know coach (Paul) Gleason is here and can do the defence, and I know I can do the offence,” Marshall said. “So, if the right offensive coordinator is available, as with coach (Steve) Snyder two years ago, I would consider it. But I’m not just going to bring anyone in. It has to fit well.”  \nMarshall said losing Malekzadeh had an immediate impact because he was a key part of the program, handling many tasks.  \n“He did everything for us,” Marshall said. “That was a big hit because it just left me doing everything, like when I started coaching 30 years ago.”  \nKaiser and Edgeworth are both teachers, great coaches, and role models for the players and will be missed, Marshall said.  \nEdgeworth, a part-time assistant for 15 years, and Kaiser are leaving to spend more time with their families.  \nWith Circelli at Windsor, Snyder at Queen’s, Chris Bertoia at Waterloo, and former Western quarterback Michael Faulds at Laurier, the Mustangs are impacting Ontario university football.  \nCircelli coached several teams, winning titles, and Snyder was also a coach with other teams.  \nBertoia, a former Mustangs coach, also coached other teams. He also coached at Catholic Central secondary school.  \nLondon’s strong high school and minor football programs are great sources for future Mustangs coaches.  \n“We have some of the best high school football in the country here,” Marshall said. “We have an excellent minor system. We have the Beefeaters and a Junior Mustangs summer program.  \n“Our coaches get great training and experience so when they come here they already coach at a high level.”",

    "Article":"Peter Dazeley \/ Photographer's Choice \/ Getty\nPerhaps it's fallout from television programming such as Nip\/Tuck or Dr. 90210 or reruns of Extreme Makeover, but Internet data shows that younger adults have become the primary audience obsessed with altering their personal appearance. Once the domain of the well-to-do female in her fifties, plastic surgery has become the obsession of the least affluent segment of younger Internet users.\nThe recent tragic death of Stephanie Kuleba, an 18-year-old high school cheerleader who died as a result of complications during a breast augmentation surgery, brought our attention to the pursuit of a more \"ideal\" body amongst teenagers. In fact, search data confirms this phenomenon. One of the most popular sites visited from the search term \"plastic surgery\" is the official site of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (www.plasticsurgery.org). Over 25% of visitors to the site (the largest segment) fell within the 18- to 24-year-old demographic  that's up from 19.6% two years ago.\nPlastic surgery has become an American obsession. Checking other markets that Hitwise has data on, such as the U.K. and Australia, the 18- to 24-year-old fascination with plastic surgery is a decidedly U.S. phenomenon.\nLooking at other health related sites visited by 18- t 24-year-olds, reveals just how obsessed this age group is with appearance. Unlike their older counterparts who visit sites related to diseases and keeping healthy, younger Internet users flock to sites that dwell on personal appearance, such as those focused on bodybuilding, weight loss and skincare. And definitely plastic surgery.\nWhile surgery-themed television may be driving the interest of a younger audience, one factor appears to be key in tempering appearance-obsessed teens from altering their bodies: the failing U.S. economy.\nIf we track the trend in searches on topics such as \"breast augmentation,\" \"breast implants\" or even \"plastic surgery,\" there has been a precipitous decline in all plastic surgery topics over the last year. What's fueling this downturn? It may very well be related to the predominant income group of visitors to cosmetic surgery sites  U.S. households that earn less than $30,000 per year. In fact, if we look at the search patterns around popular surgeries, over the last year the term \"cost\" is the most commonly appearing qualifier. We see more searches such as \"breast implant cost,\" \"plastic surgery cost,\" and \"breast augmentation cost.\" Checking these same terms in April 2007 reveals that cost sensitivity is a recent phenomenon.\nWhile older demographics continue to search for information on procedures such as face-lifts, liposuction or Botox, it's the younger Internet users who in tough economic times are focusing on improving their outer beauty, albeit at a discount price.\nBill Tancer is general manager of global research at Hitwise.\n",

    "Article":"New data presented at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting suggests a benefit to combining L-methylfolate, a prescription medical food called Deplin®, with an antidepressant at the start of treatment. This retrospective analysis showed a significantly greater improvement in depression symptoms in a shorter period of time, when patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were started on combination therapy. The retrospective study compared patients taking L-methylfolate with either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) versus patients who were only prescribed an SSRI or SNRI.\n\"We know from studies that nearly 70% of depressed individuals will not reach remission by taking one antidepressant alone, so clearly a new approach is needed,\" explained the study's principal investigator, Lawrence D. Ginsberg, M.D. of Red Oak Psychiatry, Houston, Texas. \"Adding L-methylfolate to an antidepressant at the start of treatment has valuable benefits for these patients.\"\nThe study demonstrated that:\n-- 2.5 times more patients achieved major improvements in their depressive symptoms, functionality and behavior on combination therapy than on antidepressant monotherapy.\n-- Patients on combination therapy experienced 23% more rapid improvement than those taking antidepressant monotherapy (p=0.03). The more rapid time to major improvement demonstrated in the combination group was sustained throughout the study period (approximately two years).\n-- By 60 days, patients on combination therapy had already experienced a significant improvement (p=0.011) in their CGI scores compared to those on antidepressant monotherapy.\n-- Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were significantly lower in the combination group (17.9%) versus the antidepressant monotherapy group (34%) (p=0.0078), even though the overall rates of adverse events in both groups were not statistically different.\nThe primary outcome measure used in the study was a two point decline in the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score, a seven point scale developed by the National Institute of Mental Health. The CGI-S score is a clinician-determined measure that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the patient's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient's ability to function.\n\"We found that starting patients with a combination of L-methylfolate and an antidepressant was a much more time-efficient approach to help patients get better,\" explained Dr. Ginsberg. \"Even with an aggressive endpoint, looking for a clinically relevant reduction in symptoms, we found that not only did patients on combination therapy experience a significant improvement in symptom severity but they were able to get better faster and with sustained improvement.\"\nAbout the Study\nResearchers performed a retrospective two-arm chart review of 242 adults, ages 18-70, with a primary diagnosis of MDD (single or recurrent), a CGI-S score of four (moderately ill) or five (markedly ill) and were experiencing some degree of functional impairment. Charts of eligible patients were divided into a combination group (SSRI or SNRI in combination with L-methylfolate 7.5-15 mg at treatment initiation; n=95) or a control arm (SSRI or SNRI monotherapy at treatment onset; n=147). Data were recorded on patient characteristics, including pre-treatment versus treatment scores using the CGI-S scale.\nAbout Deplin®\nDeplin is a prescription medical food for the dietary management of suboptimal L-methylfolate levels in patients with depression. Up to 70 percent of people who suffer from depression may have a specific genetic factor that compromises their ability to convert folic acid into L-methylfolate. L-methylfolate is the only form of folate that can cross the blood brain barrier and regulate serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, the neurotransmitters associated with mood.\nAbout Pamlab\nFounded in 1957, Pamlab is a fully integrated pharmaceutical company, with approximately 300 employees, specializing in prescription medical foods. Pamlab's products are marketed and sold nationally, helping hundreds of thousands of patients with depression, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, dementia, high-risk pregnancy and other diseases and conditions.\nAbout Depression\nEach year, nearly 10 percent of the population, or more than 20 million American adults, will struggle with depressive illness. MDD is a recurring and chronic illness, frequently returning for two or more episodes, with episodes that often last two years or more.

    "Article":"A UFO hunter has announced the latest bizarre “discovery” in the field of Mars anomaly research — a humanoid alien skull spotted in an image of Martian terrain captured by NASA’s Curiosity rover.\nThe discovery of an alien humanoid skull on the Red Planet by NASA’s Curiosity rover, according to UFO hunters, offers clinching evidence of advanced ancient humanoid civilization on Mars.\nUFO hunter Paranormal Crucible announced the discovery in a video uploaded to YouTube on June 6. According to the prolific Mars anomaly hunter, the discovery was made in an image taken recently by Curiosity rover’s Mastcam: Left (MAST_LEFT) on Sol 1352 (2016-05-26 05:16:25 UTC). The NASA image, according to Paranormal Crucible, who describes his YouTube channel as “Home Of The Bizarre,” shows a humanoid alien skull that resembles a “Sasquatch skull.”\nParanormal Crucible observes that the strange object “appears to resemble a large skull, obviously alien in nature.”\n“Could it be the remains of a Sasquatch or a bizarre Martian creature?” the UFO hunter wonders.\nAccording to UFO blogger Scott C. Waring, the object is evidently an ancient skull representing one of several alien species that thrived on Mars before Mars civilization was wiped out in a horrific nuclear holocaust millions of years ago.\nThe theory that ancient Mars civilization was wiped out in a nuclear holocaust is championed by Dr. John Brandenburg, theoretical plasma physicist and expert in propulsion technologies, who holds a PhD from the University of California at Davis.\nHe elaborated the strange theory in a controversial paper, titled, “Evidence of Massive Thermonuclear Explosions in Mars Past, The Cydonian Hypothesis and Fermi’s Paradox.”\nThe paper was first presented at the 2014 Annual Fall meeting of the American Physical Society, Prairie Section in Monmouth, Illinois.\nHe also presented the theory in March 2015, at the 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston, Texas, the Inquisitr reported.\nHe claimed there is evidence that two ancient Mars civilizations — Cydonia and the Utopia — were wiped out in a series of massive thermonuclear weapons explosions set off by hostile alien invaders.\nCommenting further on the alleged discovery of an alien skull on Mars, UFO blogger Scott Waring notes that “the skull is big, about the same size as a human skull.”\n“I don’t believe it is a helmet,” he adds. “A helmet would not have a perfectly formed nose area. Also the two ridges along one side are similar to ridges along bones found on Earth.”\n“The skull is big, about the same size as a human skull.”\nParanormal Crucible’s announcement of the discovery of a humanoid alien skull on Mars sparked lively discussions on multiple alien and UFO conspiracy theory forums.\nSome alien hunters agreed with Waring and Paranormal Crucible that the object was likely an alien skull. But some insisted it was more likely an ancient military helmet.\nA few who could not make up their minds suggested that NASA operators should move the rover closer to the object for a clearer view and maybe even use the rover’s robotic arm to tip it over.\n“I believe it is a helmet; petrified of course,” an alien enthusiast said.\n“We really need the rover to move over there and get a closer look,” another said, “even using the rover arm to tip it over to check it out would help.”\n“It looks like a helmet to me,” a third commented in support of the first enthusiast.\n“I would say it looks more like a skull than a helmet,” a fourth countered.\nOne enthusiast thought it “looks more like the head of a statue, rather than a skull. It reminds me of those old Greek style bronze statues where the eyes are hollow.”\nBut others found the evidence tantalizingly inconclusive.\n“I don’t know how true this maybe, but it’s interesting none the less,” an enthusiast commented.\nUncertainty whether the object was a skull or a helmet and the unlikelihood of getting NASA to move Curiosity rover closer to inspect the object sparked protests and accusations of cover-up against NASA.\n“We just want the truth! It’s not very hard?” a conspiracy theorist protested.\nIn the wacky world of Mars anomaly research, an alien skull is an unremarkable discovery.\nProbably the wackiest discovery ever by Mars anomaly hunters was a live chicken on Mars (see footage above).\nLess remarkable was the discovery of a fossil fish on Mars in April.\nIntrepid UFO hunters have found hundreds of crashed alien flying saucers and drones on the Red Planet.\nOthers have found conifer-like trees growing on the Red Planet. One alien hunter found a “weaponized robotic machine” roaming the Martian surface earlier in the week.\nSome time ago, a creative UFO hunter found an alien handgun left on Mars by a careless alien visitor.\n[Image via Shutterstock]\n",

    "Article":"(CNN) — Taking selfies at a distance of about 12 inches from the face increases perceived nose size by nearly 30%, according to a report published Thursday in the journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery.\nResearchers now are cautioning that patients interested in cosmetic procedures should not turn to self-photographs as guidance when considering making changes to their faces.\n“Patients, people, even my family have to be aware that if you’re taking a selfie, it’s not really how you look,” said Dr. Boris Paskhover, a facial plastics and reconstructive surgeon at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and a leading author on the study.\n“Selfies make your nose look wider and thicker when it really isn’t, and people like a smaller nose,” Paskhover added. “My fear is that the generation out there now doesn’t know. All they know is the selfie.”\nSelfies have quickly become emblematic of our time, thanks in part to the popularity of social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram. Within its first year of existence, Google Photos saw more than 25 billion selfies uploaded onto its servers, according to Anil Sabharwal, vice president of Google Photos.\nRelated Content: Thousands Flock to Find Their Fine Arts Doppelganger in an App\nTo put that into perspective, there are about 8 billion people living on the entire planet.\nThe selfie phenomenon might be causing people to engage in surgeries based on photographs that distort their features, Paskhover says.\nAccording to a 2018 poll conducted by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, 55% of surgeons reported having patients who said they were seeking cosmetic procedures to improve their perceived appearance in selfies or other photos posted on social media in 2017, up from 42% in 2016.\nThe JAMA study relied on data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to approximate the facial dimensions of individuals from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds in the United States. Using mathematical modeling, the researchers found that photographs taken at a distance of 12 inches increased nose size by 30% in men and 29% in women compared with photographs taken at an infinite camera distance.\nPhotographs taken at a distance of 5 feet from the subject were not shown to significantly distort nasal dimensions.\n“At 5 feet, the distance between your nose and the camera and the distance between your facial plane and the camera is almost the same,” Paskhover said. “Because the difference is very small, the nose doesn’t get skewed.”\nIn 2017, there were about 17.5 million cosmetic surgical and minimally invasive cosmetic procedures performed in the US, a 2% increase from 2016 and a 200% increase from 2000, according to a report released Thursday by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\nOf these procedures, 218,924 were nose-reshaping cosmetic surgeries.\n“Overall, cosmetic surgeries are up again,” said Dr. Jeffrey Janis, chief of plastic surgery at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. “They have trended up over the last several years, and they continue to grow.\n“I think we are all aware of the power and influence of social media on cosmetic plastic surgery,” Janis added. “People are sharing images in real time in large numbers with people that they know and, in some cases, with people that they don’t.”\nNose reshaping, or rhinoplasty, was the third most common cosmetic surgical procedure in 2017. It typically costs $6,000 to $15,000 per procedure, according to Paskhover.\nBreast augmentation was the most common cosmetic surgery performed in 2017, accounting for over 300,000 procedures. Liposuction, eyelid surgery and tummy tucks were also among the top five cosmetic surgical procedures performed last year, according to the report.\n“I think people also feel more unencumbered, more free, to talk about plastic surgery in a way that doesn’t carry any sort of social stigma,” Janis added. “But I definitely think that there’s been a lot of interest because of selfie culture.”\nRhinoplasty and other forms of plastic surgery are generally considered to be safe, but as with any surgical procedure, there are risks involved. Complications such as infection, poor wound healing and skin discoloration still occur in a small number of cases, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\nBut the biggest risk is a disconnect between the patient’s expectations and reality, according to Janis.\n“The biggest risk in my mind is actually more around levels of expectation,” he said. “You need to make sure that, number one, the patient is an appropriate candidate, and number two, you have a very thorough conversation with the patient about having appropriate levels of expectation about what can be delivered.”\nBoth Janis and Paskhover also emphasized that finding a well-trained, board-certified plastic surgeon is an important factor in the success of any cosmetic procedure.\n“The biggest risk I see with rhinoplasty is that if you go to someone who’s inexperienced, aesthetic outcomes are variable,” Paskhover said.\n“It underscores the importance of public safety,” Janis said. “You don’t want somebody who didn’t get the necessary training and doesn’t operate in an accredited facility to be operating on you.”\n",

MacDonald and Harvest Bible filed a defamation lawsuit against The Elephant's Debt bloggers, their wives, and Julie Roys, a freelance writer for World magazine who published an investigation into mismanagement in the church.\nWorld reported that Harvest shifted a large number of funds from MacDonald's popular radio program, \"Walk in the Word,\" and from its former church-planting branch, Harvest Bible Fellowship (HBF), for Harvest Bible Chapel operations. MacDonald split from HBF in 2017. In a letter obtained by World, a pastor at a former HBF church plant said the 2017 split \"occurred because HBF pastors believed Harvest had inappropriately used fellowship funds for its own purposes.\"\nHarvest's lawsuit against World said the magazine was \"asserting false allegations,\" but the suit was dismissed in January after MacDonald announced he was taking a sabbatical.\nChicago radio personality Mancow Muller, a former friend of MacDonald, spoke out in a local newspaper against the manipulation he observed around what he describes as MacDonald's \"cult of personality\" at Harvest. On his show, Muller later aired what sounded like clips of MacDonald making derogatory comments toward members of the media who had covered the story about alleged misconduct at the church.\nThe elders' statement cited those comments as part of the reason why MacDonald was fired.\n\"On Tuesday morning, highly inappropriate recorded comments made by Pastor MacDonald were given to media and reported. Given that and other conduct under consideration, in accordance with the procedures in our bylaws, Pastor MacDonald was removed as senior pastor,\" the statement reads.\nHarvest Bible Church's elders ask for prayer during this difficult time.\n\"We sincerely thank you for your prayers, your support, and your patience as we work together to restore a trust in leadership, a humility to surrender to biblical authority, and a firm resolve to move forward as a church family. Please continue to uphold our church, the Elder Board, staff, and the MacDonald family in prayer at this time,\" the statement concludes.\nAs of Wednesday, Lifeway Books had removed all of MacDonald's titles from its online catalog.

    "Article":"WHEN President Hu Jintao of China visits Washington this week, many Americans will clamor for Beijing to stop manipulating its currency. We think we are being cheated on a huge scale, but we should reconsider. When it comes to lost jobs, the negative impact of China’s currency, the renminbi, is less than one might think. Adjusting the exchange rate should not take priority over more vexing issues like North Korea, Iran and bilateral trade.\nSince China agreed to a more flexible exchange rate last summer, its currency has appreciated a measly 3.6 percent against the dollar. This is because China, just like the United States, is also worried about jobs. In going slowly on appreciation, China is giving its exporters time to adjust, thereby limiting job losses and containing social unrest.\nMany Americans believe that the Chinese jobs being preserved by an artificially low currency come at the expense of American jobs. There are three common explanations behind this theory.\nFirst, a stronger currency would increase the purchasing power of Chinese consumers and decrease the relative cost of American goods in China, spurring more Chinese to buy more American products. Second, a stronger currency increases the relative cost of Chinese goods in third markets, like Europe or Latin America. So if the renminbi appreciates, consumers in other countries will shy away from Chinese products in favor of American products. Third, a stronger currency would increase labor costs in China, making it less attractive for American companies to move jobs to China and thus keeping more people employed at home.\nThese claims, however, are more wishful thinking than actual truths. Consider the first idea, that a strengthened Chinese currency would increase the growth rate of American exports to China. From 2005 to 2008, the renminbi appreciated nearly 20 percent against the dollar. Yet, American exports to China over those three years grew at a slightly slower pace than in the previous three-year period when the renminbi did not appreciate at all (71 percent versus 89 percent).\nThis is because many of America’s top exports to China are for capital-intensive goods like aerospace and power-generation equipment. Price is but one of several factors for these purchases, along with technology, quality and service. In addition, American companies in those industries are usually competing against European and Japanese firms rather than Chinese manufacturers. Ultimately, the dollar-euro and dollar-yen exchange rates may play more important roles in Chinese demand for American goods than the renminbi rate.\nSecond, I recently did an analysis of the top American exports to our 20 leading foreign markets, and found little evidence that an undervalued Chinese currency hurts American exports to third countries. This is mostly because there is little head-to-head competition between America and China. In less than 15 percent of top export products — for example, network routers and solar panels — are American and Chinese corporations competing directly against one another. By and large, we are going after entirely different product markets; we market things like airplanes and pharmaceuticals while China sells electronics and textiles.\nFinally, it is unlikely that a stronger renminbi would bring many jobs back home. Instead, companies would most likely shift labor-intensive production to Vietnam, Indonesia and other low-wage countries. And in any case many high-skilled jobs will continue to flow overseas, as long as cheaper talent can be found in India and elsewhere. Only in a few industries, like biomedical devices, would a stronger Chinese currency combined with quality issues tempt American companies to keep more manufacturing at home.\nDon’t get me wrong: China’s currency policies have led to unhealthy artificial distortions in the Chinese and world economy. They also fuel currency wars that threaten to undermine the cooperation needed to sustain a global recovery. And while the effect on American workers is far less than imagined, workers in the developing world stand much to gain from a faster renminbi appreciation.\nWe should discuss currency issues with China, but the exchange rate should not be at the top of the bilateral agenda. The issue is best left to the Group of 20, for this is as much the rest of the world’s problem as it is ours. Resolving our economic troubles will depend much more on reinvesting in education, transportation and other government services, basic science and applied research than on forcing China to yield on its currency.\n",

    "GPT_Result":"When President Hu Jintao of China comes to Washington this week, many Americans will want Beijing to stop changing its currency unfairly. We feel we are being cheated a lot, but we need to think again. The bad effect of China’s currency, the renminbi, on lost jobs is smaller than we think. Changing the exchange rate should not be more important than other serious issues like North Korea, Iran, and two-way trade.\nSince last summer, China agreed to let its exchange rate be a little more flexible, and its currency has increased by only 3.6 percent against the dollar. This is because China, like the United States, also worries about jobs. By being slow with appreciation, China gives its exporters time to adapt, which limits job losses and controls social unrest.\nMany Americans think that keeping Chinese jobs with a low currency takes away American jobs. There are three common reasons for this idea.\nFirst, a stronger currency would make Chinese consumers able to buy more and would lower the cost of American goods in China, encouraging them to buy American products. Second, a stronger currency raises the cost of Chinese goods in other markets, like Europe or Latin America. If the renminbi goes up, consumers in other countries may avoid Chinese products and buy American ones instead. Third, a stronger currency would increase labor costs in China, making it less attractive for American companies to move jobs there and keeping more people working in America.\nThese claims, however, are more like hopeful thinking than real truths. Look at the first idea, that a stronger Chinese currency would help American exports grow in China. From 2005 to 2008, the renminbi went up nearly 20 percent against the dollar. Yet, American exports to China during those three years grew a bit slower than in the past three years when the renminbi did not rise at all (71 percent versus 89 percent).\nThis is because many of America’s main exports to China are capital-intensive goods like aerospace and power equipment. Price is just one of many factors for these buys, along with technology, quality, and service. Also, American businesses in these industries usually compete with European and Japanese firms, not Chinese ones. In the end, the dollar-euro and dollar-yen exchange rates might be more important for Chinese buying of American goods than the renminbi rate.\nSecond, I recently checked the top American exports to our 20 main foreign markets, and found little proof that a low Chinese currency harms American exports to other countries. This is mainly because American and Chinese companies compete directly in less than 15 percent of the top export products, such as network routers and solar panels. Mostly, we target different product markets; America markets airplanes and medicine while China sells electronics and textiles.\nLastly, it is not likely that a stronger renminbi would bring many jobs back to America. Instead, companies would probably move labor-intensive work to Vietnam, Indonesia, and other low-wage countries. And anyway, many skilled jobs will keep going abroad as long as cheaper talent is in places like India. Only in a few fields, like biomedical devices, would a strong Chinese currency mixed with quality issues make American companies want to keep more production at home.\nDon’t misunderstand me: China’s currency choices have caused unhealthy and fake changes in the Chinese and world economy. They also cause currency fights that could harm the teamwork needed for global recovery. While the effect on American workers is less than people think, workers in developing countries could gain much from a faster renminbi rise.\nWe should talk about currency issues with China, but the exchange rate should not be the most important topic. This issue suits the Group of 20 better since it is the world's problem, not just ours. Fixing our economic problems will depend more on reinvesting in education, transport, and other government services, and research, than on pushing China to change its currency.",

    "Article":"Naval Wives & Mistresses\nby Margarette Lincoln\n218pp, National Maritime Museum, £20\nThe god of British naval history, NAM Rodger, once wrote that the social history of the Georgian service would remain incomplete until somebody researched its wives, mothers, sweethearts, trollops and other females left ashore. The wooden warship world is easy to animate; you can pursue the technicalities (all the crafts of ship construction and operation), the hierarchies (exactly how far below the salt was a sailing master?), the strategy, tactics and grog rations through the archives, and compose logbook poetry: \"HMS . . . 28 guns, 197 souls, N coast Brazil.\" But where's the material to raise the women from the deep? Margarette Lincoln, deputy director of the National Maritime Museum, wants to perform this necromancy while subscribing to male rules about facts (sums of money are evidence, court proceedings reliable, statistics sound), and has clearly worked hard to find the stuff.\nTrue, the upper strata of society and the service were habitual letter-writers in the period of her book, the mid 18th century to the end of the Napoleonic wars; although what survives tends to be incomplete correspondence, a single voice of a duet and not always private, since the gold-braided classes jostled in social networking. Lady Amelia Calder, wife to a rear admiral, fluttered at the Admiralty: \"I do desire that you will not be such Savages tomorrow as you have been hitherto, and let us have proper letters by Tuesday's Post.\" How Lady Elizabeth Collins badgered for her son's advancement can be deduced from the First Lord of the Admiralty's reply: \"Madam, It would be very gratifying to me if I had the power to comply with the innumerable applications that are made to me for promotion, and particularly so with your Ladyships . . .\" It wasn't that the spouses of the grandest had little to do but chivvy for glory, since many had to manage estates while their husbands were on the far side of the world and the furthest end of a fouled chain of mail deliveries for years at a time. Admiral Codrington dispatched what sound like Post-it notes to his wife instructing her when to paint the garret floors; Mrs Admiral Boscawen filed business reports to her husband (her barley was the best in the parish) and remembered to send a framed print of him to the Corporation of Truro. This was the Penelope side of being \"a hero's wife\", interrupted on no notice when she had to set out in a chaise in hope of a short port rendezvous. Often enough, the beloved had already heaved off with the tide and the hamper of tender provisions never reached him.\nBut aside from Admiral Rodney, whose financial worries were legendary, status and money were not the nagging concern in the highest echelons that they were among the middling sort, for whom going to sea as an officer in this period was one of the few possible fast tracks not just to income but prize money, everything that Sir Walter Elliot sneered at in Persuasion as \"the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their father and grandfathers never dreamt of\". Fictional Captain Wentworth came back from the wars with £25,000 to rescue Anne Elliot and Jane Austen's plot, but nonfictional rewards were less sure; Austen's brother Charles didn't do that well from prizes and he shipped his family aboard to live economically, which likely caused the death of his wife after childbirth. Finance niggles through the middling stories, the prospect of reduction to half-pay come peace or illness; even in fighting-fit years, a man's shipboard expenses could absorb so much income that a couple might not be able to afford to meet or to pay postage. William Wilkinson, ship's master, told his Sally that everything he owned was hers, and sold his flute for two and a half guineas to settle their bills until the Copenhagen prize money should be paid out.\nLike most of the narratives Lincoln has retrieved, the Wilkinsons' story stops abruptly after this pinched patch, possibly because no more was available, or because Lincoln's technique is to set out her theses - strain of separation, fears of shipwreck - then add a sample human example to substantiate them. The lower the deck, the briefer the entry - Elenor Broderick, a boatswain's widow, asked her husband's former captain to petition a charity, for she and her children were \"in the midst of the greatest distress and Poverty that ever was Experienced\". That's it. Below Elenor there wasn't literacy to scrawl a trace, and Lincoln must do what she can with legal records of women executed for fraudulent claims for navy pay or the murder of a bastard before its non-dad came ashore. The poor whores leave hardly a mark behind, except in songs and prints.\nLincoln prefers to keep her scholarly speculation abstract (women as consumers, gender expectations and so on), but these lives can only be grasped through the texture and tone of days. They left echoes rather than records. Sweet Poll of Plymouth, shown in a 1790 print as drunk, plumptious and supported by affable Devon matelots, was familiar round Stonehouse and Devonport in my childhood: her billowy descendants cruised Union Street pubs in seagreen eyeshadow and fetched up in Beryl Cook paintings. If you were raised in households with dawn calls of \"Rouse up, sleepers awake, show a leg there\", among ditty boxes and duffle bags, dockyardies and Plymouth Gin, male relatives whose absences were spaced over long seasons and women relatives with gale-force tempers those men feared, then nothing is needed to bring this world to the surface but a line from a folk song - \"My love it will endure, dear, like a beacon in the squall \/ Eternal as the oggy man beneath the dockyard wall.\" And if you weren't, Lincoln's \"relationships between the sexes were affected by local, practical circumstances as well as by ideological and cultural precepts\" won't whistle up a wind.\n",

    "GPT_Result":"Naval Wives & Mistresses by Margarette Lincoln is 218 pages and published by the National Maritime Museum, costing £20. NAM Rodger, a famous British naval historian, said we need to research the women left ashore to complete the social history of the Georgian navy. The world of wooden warships is easy to study with technical details, hierarchies, and records, but where is the information to talk about the women? Margarette Lincoln, deputy director of the National Maritime Museum, wants to find this information while using men's rules about facts, like money and court records as evidence, and she has clearly worked hard to find it. \n\nIn the time of her book, from the mid-18th century to the end of the Napoleonic wars, people from high society wrote many letters. Although, the letters we have now are not complete, usually showing only one side of the conversation, and they were not always private as important people mixed in social circles. Lady Amelia Calder, wife of a rear admiral, wrote to the Admiralty: \"I hope you will not be so cruel tomorrow as you have been before, and please let us have proper letters by Tuesday's Post.\" From the First Lord of the Admiralty's reply, we can tell Lady Elizabeth Collins asked a lot for her son's promotion: \"Madam, I would like to help with the many requests for promotions, especially yours...\" The wives of high-ranking men did more than just ask for favors; they managed their homes while their husbands were away for years with slow mail delivery. Admiral Codrington sent notes telling his wife when to paint rooms; Mrs. Admiral Boscawen sent business reports to her husband and sent an image of him to Truro's officials. These wives had to be ready to suddenly travel to meet their husbands at ports, but often the ship sailed away before they got there.\n\nMoney and status were less of a worry for top-ranking officers compared to middle-class officers, for whom sea jobs were one of the few ways to quickly gain income and prize money. This idea is seen in Jane Austen's story \"Persuasion\" where Sir Walter Elliot did not like how the navy allowed people of lower birth to gain high positions and respect. Fictional Captain Wentworth returned from the wars with £25,000, but real rewards were often less certain; Austen's brother Charles did not earn much prize money and lived with his family on the ship, which likely led to his wife's death after childbirth. In middle-class stories, money problems appear often, like the worry of having only half-pay after peace or illness, and ship expenses could be so high that some couples could not afford to meet or send letters. William Wilkinson, a ship's master, told his wife Sally that everything he owned was hers, and he sold his flute for two and a half guineas to pay bills until he got his prize money.\n\nLike most of Lincoln's stories, the Wilkinsons' story ends suddenly after their financial trouble, maybe because nothing more was found, or because Lincoln shows her ideas by giving a human example of each, like separation or shipwreck fears. The lower on the social ladder, the shorter the story - Elenor Broderick, a boatswain's widow, asked her husband's captain to ask a charity for help because she and her children were \"in the greatest distress and Poverty.\" That is all. Below Elenor, there was little literacy to leave a mark, so Lincoln uses legal records about women hanged for false navy pay claims or the murder of a child before its father returned. Poor women left little record, except in songs and prints.\n\nLincoln keeps her theories abstract like women as consumers, gender roles, but these lives are best understood through everyday experiences. They made echoes rather than records. Sweet Poll of Plymouth, shown in a 1790 print as drunk and friendly with sailors, was well-known in areas around Plymouth when I was young: women like her were seen in local pubs and Beryl Cook paintings. If you grew up with morning calls like \"Wake up, show a leg,\" with sailors' belongings, and with family absent for long times and strong women, then you only need a line from a folk song to remember this world. If not, Lincoln's idea that relationships were influenced by local and cultural factors might not really bring this world to life for you.",

    "Article":"Women with lupus, an autoimmune disorder that can attack a variety of tissues, were once counseled to avoid pregnancy. Now, physicians tailor their advice to each patient's case. In many instances, however, it's difficult for physicians to gauge what types of risk their patient might be facing.\nA new study designed to clarify those risks found that women with lupus during pregnancy — and even women who may soon be diagnosed with lupus — are more likely to experience preeclampsia, stroke and infection than women without lupus. Infants born to mothers with lupus or pre-lupus are also more likely to be born preterm, have infections, or be small for gestational age, according to the paper, which was published today in Arthritis Care and Research.\n\"We’ve confirmed previous findings while strengthening the data to show that lupus is associated with a variety of adverse pregnancy outcomes both to the mother, and to the infant,\" said senior author Julia Simard, ScD, assistant professor of health research and policy at Stanford.\nThe research team, which included collaborators in Sweden and at several U.S. universities, examined data from population-based Swedish registers. That data set allowed the researchers to identify patients who had babies several years before being diagnosed with lupus. From 13,598 single, first-time births, the team identified 551 women with existing lupus and 198 who presented with lupus within five years after giving birth.\nFor women who have not yet been diagnosed, it's possible that autoantibodies implicated in the disease may lead to some of the adverse outcomes, but the exact mechanisms remain unknown, Simard said.\nShe and others are also working to clarify the clinical ramifications of the work, which may help refine physicians' recommendations and care of pregnant women with lupus, and may lead to earlier diagnoses.\nThis is a descriptive study, Simard cautioned. Lupus is a challenging condition to study, because it can manifest differently in every patient. As with other chronic diseases, it's also difficult to distinguish between conditions that could strike anyone, and conditions that might be caused by lupus, she said.\nPreviously: Empowered is as empowered does: Making a choice about living with lupus, Women and men's immune system genes operate differently, Stanford study shows , Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis may mean fewer children for female patients and Why some autoimmune diseases go into remission during pregnancy\nPhoto by J.K.

    "Article":"Sensitive portrait of a woman destined to think outside the box, a free spirit that has made an indelible print on Australian cinema\nThe first novel by Australian feminist Miles Franklin, written when she was a teenager and published in 1901, launched more than a single brilliant career. There was her own: Franklin produced a bounty of acclaimed books and forged a legacy as one of the country’s most influential authors. And almost 80 years later Judy Davis rose to prominence after starring in director Gillian Armstrong’s fine 1979 adaptation.\nDavis gives a rousing performance as bull-headed protagonist Sybylla Melvyn. The term “once in a lifetime” tends to be slapped around like a bumper sticker, but this meaty role lives up to the accolade. Davis won a Bafta award for her troubles and went on to form a long and distinguished CV.\n“Here is the story of my career. My brilliant career. I make no apologies for being egotistical because I am,” Sybylla intones in her opening narration, with a characteristically smug, holier-than-thou temperament that makes her one of the most memorable characters in Australian cinema. While a sandstorm erupts in the dusty outback around her she writes a diary entry reflecting on her desire to belong to the world of art and literature.\nWith those sun-baked rural locations, it’s obvious from the get-go that My Brilliant Career will be a quintessentially Australian story, set in a quintessentially Australian context. The themes of the film are broad (breaking free of the establishment, being true to yourself) and its message about the virtues and consequences of self-empowerment timeless.\nFrom that opening moment it’s unclear whether Sybylla’s “brilliant career” is wishful thinking or an ambition destined to be realised by the closing credits. Part of the strength and nuance of Armstrong’s film (and the book on which it was based) is that the end result is both – and neither.\nSybylla’s aspirations are realised in the sense that her independence is protected, her integrity maintained and her creative voice given an outlet. But despite those virtues – or perhaps because of them – the people around her, constituents of an atavistic male-dominated hierarchy, remain unconvinced of her success and deeply sceptical of her intentions.\n“Useless, plain and godless” is how Sybylla’s mother describes her early in the film, when Armstrong is still doing the heavy lifting to establish her protagonist as a maligned free spirit rubbing up against the established order of things. In the next scene Sybylla talks to her sister, below the stars, and asks her if she’s dreamed of a better life – of adventure, books and culture, things beyond a farm-girl existence that oscillates between two modes: work and sleep.\nA young woman dreaming of something greater than provincial life is a familiar narrative trajectory, but My Brilliant Career is the seminal work; the grandmother of feminist narratives, built around a character whose determination to live independent of societal expectations took place in a time well before the struggle for women’s rights became a movement.\nDespite a touching romantic subplot featuring a dashing Sam Neill as Harry Beecham – one of the rare people who don’t talk down to, patronise or discourage Sybylla – the film doesn’t replace the lonely dignity of its protagonist with rosiness and romance. She ends the film as she began it, writing pensive thoughts into her diary, having refused Beecham’s hand in marriage. The dignity of the film and its subject remains heartbreakingly intact.\nThere’s no wonder My Brilliant Career is cited as a milestone in Australian feminist cinema. It is a powerful rumination on atavistic Australia, sexism and classism, and a sensitive portrait of a woman destined to think outside the box. Sybylla’s artistic aspirations keep the film relevant and broadly accessible. Pressure from people around her comes in many forms, even in something as innocuous as playing piano. She is instructed “play the nice ones”.\nMy Brilliant Career isn’t “a nice one”. Like its protagonist, it is staunchly unconventional. The film itself is a kind of free spirit, and one that has made an indelible print on Australian cinema.\n",

    "GPT_Result":"Sensitive story of a woman who thinks differently, a free spirit who changed Australian cinema.\nThe first book by Australian feminist Miles Franklin, written as a teenager and published in 1901, started more than one great career. Franklin wrote many famous books and became one of the country’s most important authors. Almost 80 years later, Judy Davis became famous after starring in director Gillian Armstrong’s excellent 1979 film version.\nDavis gives a strong performance as the stubborn main character Sybylla Melvyn. People often use “once in a lifetime” carelessly, but this important role deserves it. Davis won a Bafta award for her efforts and went on to have a long and impressive career.\n“Here is the story of my career. My brilliant career. I make no apologies for being egotistical because I am,” Sybylla says at the start, showing her proud and confident character that makes her one of the most memorable figures in Australian cinema. While dust flies in the outback around her, she writes in her diary about wanting to be part of the art and literature world.\nWith its sunny rural locations, it is clear from the start that My Brilliant Career is an Australian story set in an Australian setting. The film’s themes are broad (breaking free, being true to yourself) and its message about the importance and results of self-empowerment is timeless.\nAt the start, it is unclear if Sybylla’s “brilliant career” is just a wish or a dream that will come true by the end. Armstrong’s film (and the book it is based on) is strong because the end is both – and neither.\nSybylla’s dreams come true as she keeps her independence, stays true to herself, and expresses her creativity. But because of these things, the people around her, in a male-dominated world, doubt her success and her goals.\n“Useless, plain and godless” is how Sybylla’s mother describes her early in the film, while Armstrong shows Sybylla as a misunderstood free spirit fighting against the way things are. In the next scene, Sybylla talks to her sister under the stars about dreaming of a better life with adventure, books, and culture beyond the simple life of farming.\nA young woman dreaming of more than country life is a common story, but My Brilliant Career is a key work; it’s one of the first feminist stories about a woman living her own way before the women’s rights movement.\nEven with a heartfelt romantic part with Sam Neill as Harry Beecham – one of the few people who supports Sybylla – the film doesn’t replace her lonely strength with romance. She ends the film like it began, writing serious thoughts in her diary, after refusing Beecham’s marriage offer. The strength of the film and Sybylla’s story remains sadly unchanged.\nIt’s no surprise My Brilliant Career is seen as an important film in Australian feminist cinema. It is a strong story about old-fashioned Australia, sexism, and classism, and a sensitive story of a woman who thinks differently. Sybylla’s artistic dreams keep the film important and interesting to many people. Pressure from others comes in many forms, even in playing piano. She is told to “play the nice ones.”\nMy Brilliant Career isn’t “a nice one”. Like Sybylla, it is very unconventional. The film itself is a free spirit and has made a lasting mark on Australian cinema.",

Rights holders and the government would also be authorized to serve that order on payment processors and online advertising networks. Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) has scheduled a cloture vote on a bill for Jan. 24 that will require at least 60 votes to advance for debate and a final vote.\n• Web tax bill: A revised Senate measure would enable states to collect sales taxes from out-of-state merchants regardless of whether they have a physical presence in the state. The bill is backed by traditional retailers and has support from long-time opponent Amazon.com, which improves its chances.\n• PNTR for Russia: Congress is expected to take up legislation granting permanent normal trade relations to Russia, a required step in order for U.S. companies to gain the full benefits of Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization.\n• China currency bill: Although the legislation’s prospects remain uncertain, it could gain momentum this year if China’s currency continues to fall against the dollar. The bill passed the Senate in October, but House leaders have refused to bring it to a vote, claiming it could spark a trade war with China. The bill would direct the Commerce Department to treat undervalued currency as an illegal export subsidy, which could lead to punitive tariffs on imports from China and other nonmarket economy countries.\n",

    "Article":"ISLAMABAD: Amid rising prices despite subsidised imported stocks, the Economic Coordination Com­­­mittee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Tuesday directed the Ministry of Industries and Production (MoIP) to chalk out a plan for continuous and smooth operation of urea plants in the country throughout the year.\nThe meeting presided over by Finance Minister Asad Umar also could not take a conclusive decision on two other major agenda items — signing of fuel supply agreement with Azer­baijan and payment of dues to employees of Pakistan Machine Tool Factory — owing chiefly to lack of prior consultations.\nWhile reviewing the fertiliser demand and supply situation, the ECC directed MoIP for easy availability of sufficient urea stocks to meet demand of the farmers’ community.\nAdvises further consultations on fuel supply deal with Azerbaijan\nSources said the meeting was informed that while reasonable urea stocks were available in the country augmented by 100,000 tonnes of imports last month, the price did not fall below Rs1,850-1,860 per 50 kg bag in the market against a price set at Rs1,712 per bag for imported ­commodity.\nIt was observed that some fertiliser plants were not releasing their stocks to the desired level due to upcoming annual maintenance schedule. Also, the subsidies on account of imported and domestic gas blend on a long-term basis was also an issue as existing arrangements would come to an end by close of this month for two fertiliser plants — Fatima and Agritech.\nThe meeting was informed that the provincial government did not intervene into the matter as required. It was pointed out that a crackdown on hoarders was delayed on the request of some fertiliser companies and their distribution networks and the fertiliser review committee or the ECC had also not pressed for such a move in their respective meetings last month to avoid an impression of harassment.\nSources said some members of the committee were of the view that decision making on transaction to transaction would be an inappropriate course of action given the fact that gas suppliers, fertiliser producers and the end consumers and policy makers keep changing their positions month after the month.\nWhile about Rs4.7 billion supplementary grant had been approved by the federal cabinet for gas supply and its subsidy mechanism until end-January for domestic production im­­ports, there should be clear line of action based on all the factors on a year-long basis. It was also highlighted that an early decision was required on allocation of about 66 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of additional gas from Mari field.\nThe ECC while considering the proposal regarding provision of funds for personnel related dues in the Pakistan Machine Tool Factory (PMTF), directed the Ministry of Industries and Production to come up with a strategy to revitalise the unit.\nThe ECC observed that the PMTF had done great service for the engineering sector and had the potential to effectively carry on this role, for which it needed to be strengthened.\nThe ECC approved proposal of Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for supply of up to 25mmcfd additional gas from Adhi Gas Field to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL) to meet the existing gas demand on the system.\nECC also discussed proposal of Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for fuel supply agreement bet­ween Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and State Oil Com­pany of Republic of Azer­bai­jan (Socar). The Committee advised Ministry of Energy to carry out further consultations with stakeholders including Ministry of Com­merce and Public Procure­ment Regulatory Authority before a final decision in the matter.\nThe meeting was infor­med that PSO and Socar had finalised a term sale and purchase agreement (TSPA) for supply of petroleum products under an inter-­governmental agreement (IGA) signed by the two governments in February 2017.\nAfter vetting the TSPA, the Law Division had desired its approval by the board of directors of the PSO. While approving the TSPA, the PSO board directed the company to ensure its approval from the federal cabinet as required under Rule 5 of Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules 2004.\nThe Rule 5 required that whenever PPRA rules come in conflict with an obligation or commitment of the Federal Government arising out of an International treaty or an agreement with a State or States, or any international financial institution, the provisions of such international treaty or agreement shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.\nThe Petroleum Division had proposed to the ECC that since the TSPA was finalised under a bilateral government agreement and the two companies were owned by the two states, the ECC and the cabinet should clear the commercial arrangement between the two companies. The ECC desired that opinion of the commerce ministry in terms of import and that of procurement authority in terms of exemption of competitive bidding should be obtained before reaching a final decision.\nPublished in Dawn, January 2nd, 2019\n",

    "Article":"Chris Rock has been testing out his Oscar-night material this past week at L.A. comedy clubs to good effect, though he’s officially staying mum on what he has planned.\nOn Monday, a fan tweeted to him, “You really killed it at the Comedy Store last night.” Rock also did stand-up at the Largo last Thursday at an event hosted by Judd Apatow.\nCompared to past Oscar hosts, Rock has been relatively quiet, though he posted two photos on Instagram on Monday that seem like clues. One photo features him in a NASA astronaut suit with the caption “Getting my outfit together,” and another featured him with Kristen Wiig and J.J. Abrams captioned “Almost showtime.” Wiig and Abrams rep the year’s biggest outer-space movies, “The Martian” and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” respectively.\nReporting on the Largo gig, the Observer’s Andy Wang said Rock naturally made jokes about diversity, but went beyond that, also offering one-liners about Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, El Chapo, Oscar fashions and non-Hollywood topics such as divorce and dating. Wang discreetly opted not to divulge the gags, but said Rock’s standup included a joke about “the absurdity of one particular boycott. That bit included a withering, perfect punchline involving two celebrities, but Mr. Rock knew it was too lewd to get by the Oscar censors.”\nLast December, Rock spoke with Essence magazine about gender inequality in Hollywood, and particularly the struggles by women of color to get hired. The March issue features an interview by Isabel Wilkerson that was conducted several weeks before #OscarsSoWhite got so intense. Rock told her, “I’ve never done a movie, any movie, the silliest movie, where someone, some studio person, hasn’t gone ‘Does the girl have to be black?’ It happens every time. Black women get paid less than everybody in Hollywood.”\nWhile Jennifer Lawrence spoke up about the gender gap in Hollywood paydays, Rock said most black actresses “would love to get to Jennifer Lawrence’s place.”\nRock first hosted the Oscars a decade ago, and was similarly low-key about advance publicity. But in a Feb. 14, 2005, interview with Variety, the show’s producer that year, Gil Cates, laughed that he was constantly being asked how he would “control” Chris Rock. Due to Rock’s language on his HBO specials, Variety admitted he seemed “a raunchy choice.” But Cates countered: “He’s very thoughtful and intelligent. His humor is basically intellectual humor. He deals with race and business and politics.”\nIn a review of the Oscarcast, Variety‘s Brian Lowry praised Rock, saying he had a funny monologue with barbs at Bush Administration “but did not draw blood.”\nThis year, the Oscar show is being produced by Reginald Hudlin and David Hill. The latter, an Oscar first-timer but a veteran of live TV, vowed to Variety that they plan to bring in the show on time. The Oscars will be held Feb. 28 at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland.\n",

    "Article":"The release of the iPhone 6 is one of the most debated events at the moment. The iPhone 6 is without a doubt an expected device, so everyone is interested in finding out what this new smartphone will feature.\nWell, new reports indicate that the upcoming iPhone will be released by Apple at the event the famous company is planning for September 9. Some reports indicate that at this event Apple will actually introduce two new iPhones. On one hand, the famous smartphone maker will present an iPhone with a 4.7 inch screen, while on the other hand Apple will introduce a 5.5 inch model.\nWell, when it comes to the features of the new device, it has been said that Apple will introduce the sapphire display in its iPhone 6. So, the new display might be presented in just one week. However, there are numerous opinions on what the new display will bring. Some analysts say that the sapphire display will actually add an extra cost to the new iPhone.\nSo, sapphire is really expensive to produce and this might mean a $100 increase to the cost of the new iPhone. However, Apple has always tried to introduce on the market strong, scratch resistant screens, so maybe the company will once again put its bet on quality, even though this might mean higher costs.\nAnalysts also say that the sapphire display will bring an important benefit to customers when it comes to the resistance of the screen, which can be really important. The durability and resistance to scratches of such a display will actually make it pointless for users to have screen protectors. After all, sapphire is the toughest substance out there.\nThe usage of sapphire is not actually new in the production of the iPhone. In fact, sapphire is currently used on the home button’s fingerprint scanner, but also on the cover for the built-in camera. Well, if this great technology will be used in the new iPhone, Apple will actually address one of the main issues that customers have when it comes to smartphones: screens break easily when dropped on the ground. It is yet to see at which cost will come this feature.\n",

    "Article":"It's been a tough run for Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) of late. The company has provided investors a 42% return, including dividends, over the past five years, versus the greater S&P's return of 87%. Compared with its biggest rival, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola's underperformance is more pronounced, as the former has provided investors a 90% return, double the return of Coca-Cola.\nIn the third-quarter conference call, CEO James Quincey identified three broad tenets for growth. However, the last one received the bulk of the attention:\nWe're looking at opportunities in growing premium segments such as adult craft beverages. As you know, more consumers, most notably adults, are seeking unique and distinct products with sophisticated flavors, quality ingredients, and smaller-scale craft production.\nLater, and after considerable media interest, Quincey walked back his comments by saying although he'd \"never say never,\" he feels moving into alcohol doesn't make sense now. However, often the best solution is one already in front of you: Coca-Cola should lay off the booze and fully acquire Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST).\nAcquisitions have been key for Pepsi and Coca-Cola\nWhile Pepsi's outperformance is recent, the roots of the company's strategy are more than 50 years old. In 1965, PepsiCo was formed through a merger of the Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay companies. Since then, the company has operated as a food and drink conglomerate, buying beverages such as Tropicana, SoBe Beverages, and IZZE Beverage Company for growth and diversification. Recently, while soft-drink sales have slumped because of health concerns, Pepsi's other brands have picked up the slack.\nCoca-Cola has continued to focus on beverages, only recently turning to acquisitions to grow its bottom line. In 2015, the company took a 16.7% stake in Monster and added a strategic partnership to expand Monster's global capabilities.\nSince Coca-Cola accounts for Monster under the equity-accounting method, it's easy to see just how profitable its stake in Monster has been. In the company's recent earnings report, Coke reported the fair value of its investment in Monster Beverage Corporation to be $5.6 billion. Meanwhile, the carrying value -- the price paid, plus earnings, minus dividends -- is $3.4 billion. In the event Coke sold Monster shares today, it would have a pre-tax gain of $2.3 billion, or 68%.\nListen to yourself\nWhile the alcohol comment received more attention from the press, more telling was Quincey's other two prescripts for growth. The first was to identify and incubate high-growth brands; the second was to nurture and expand small brands internationally, whether in-house or by partnerships. While Monster may not technically qualify as a small brand, given its $34 billion market cap, it's due to the company's tremendous growth.\nIn the quarter ended Sept. 30, Monster reported year-on-year revenue growth of 15.4%, bolstered by a whopping 36% international growth. In the corresponding conference call, Monster CEO Rodney Sacks noted (emphasis mine):\nWe continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally.\nCoca-Cola already has a way to increase growth through an acquisition, and it doesn't require buying new, unknown companies or entering into new markets potentially outside its circle of competence. To consolidate Monster onto its financial statements requires a \"control stake,\" often considered 50% or greater. In the long run, this would be money well spent.\n",

More adult consumers want special products with unique flavors, quality ingredients, and small-scale production.\n\nLater, after much media interest, Quincey said moving into alcohol does not make sense now. He suggested Coca-Cola should stop thinking about alcohol and instead buy all of Monster Beverage Corporation. \n\nAcquisitions are important for growth for both Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Pepsi's strong performance is not new as it started over 50 years ago. In 1965, Pepsi merged with Frito-Lay, and since then, it bought drinks like Tropicana and SoBe for growth. Recently, as soda sales fell, Pepsi's other brands have become more important. \n\nCoca-Cola has mainly focused on drinks and recently started buying companies to grow. In 2015, Coca-Cola bought 16.7% of Monster and partnered to grow Monster's global reach. \n\nCoca-Cola can see how profitable its stake in Monster is. In a recent report, the value of its Monster investment is $5.6 billion, while the price paid was $3.4 billion. If Coke sold Monster shares now, it would gain $2.3 billion, or 68%, before tax.\n\nWhile alcohol talk got more media attention, Quincey's other growth ideas are important. The first was to find high-growth brands; the second was to expand small brands internationally, through in-house efforts or partnerships. Although Monster is not a small brand with its $34 billion market cap, it is growing a lot.\n\nIn the quarter ended Sept. 30, Monster's revenue grew 15.4% with 36% growth internationally. In the conference call, Monster CEO Rodney Sacks said: We trust our growth strategy and will continue to grow our brands and expand abroad, especially with Coke's help.\n\nCoca-Cola can grow through an acquisition without buying new companies or going into new markets. To fully integrate Monster, Coca-Cola would need a \"control stake,\" usually 50% or more. In the future, this could be a smart investment.",

    "Article":"The following is a post that was originally featured on The Young Austinian and written by Katherine Hysmith, who is part of POPSUGAR Select Food.\nI already know what you're going to say. \"Butternut squash in an enchilada?! Have you forgotten your raisin' girl?\" But there's logic — in addition to damn tasty enchiladas — behind this idea; just hear me out. Do you remember the Native American story of the Three Sisters? Well, it refers to the three agricultural crops — specifically corn, squash, and beans — that grow so well together and create a complete vegetarian protein. In many Native communities, these plants were often grown together, as the corn and its stalks created a structure for the beans to climb, which, in turn, provided much-needed nitrogen for the soil. The squash, with its large shady leaves that grow and crawl like wildfire, provided ground cover and weed control. And the various amino acids in the beans and squash help the body break down the nutrients that we couldn't otherwise access in the corn.\nIf you serve these enchiladas with a side of beans — and just FYI, to do otherwise is considered blasphemy south of the Red River — and there you have a complete plate. Sweet, food scholar logic.\nAnd I know you're still thinking, \"but are these some kind of fancy vegetarian-friendly enchiladas?\" Well, yes, they are, but they are much, much more than that. When the roasted squash is baked with the shredded cheese, it creates this gooey filling that is so perfectly met with the acidic spice of the red sauce that you will never want plain ol' cheese enchiladas ever again. I'm almost hesitant to tell you, but in addition to all this, you are also eating a serving or two of a vegetable you might not otherwise eat. And I think it's high time I tell you that I, The Young Austinian, do not like squash of any kind. But with enough cheese and a distracting American folklore introduction, I'll eat just about anything.\nSince these take a bit of assembling, you can easily make these ahead of time (saving the last step) and refrigerate until ready to use (up to a day or so). The sauce is also easily made in advance and frankly tastes good on just about anything vaguely Tex-Mex related. These butternut squash enchiladas would also make a fitting, and filling, vegetarian entrée for any of the turkey averse at Friendsgiving or Thanksgiving gatherings.\n",

    "Article":"Researchers at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa have developed innovative techniques that could have profound effects on congenital cervical vertebrae malformation research.\nIn the cover-featured research article of the November issue of Molecular Reproduction and Development, researchers looked into congenital cervical vertebrae malformation in humans that can cause neural problems and increase susceptibility to stillbirth in women. Research advancement on abnormal vertebrae development has been limited due to the lack of lab animals with taxonomic equivalency to humans (animal models), and restrictions on human subject research.\nLeading the research effort was Dr. Jinzeng Yang, a molecular biologist in the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources’ Department of Human Nutrition, Food and Animal Sciences. Researchers from Yang’s laboratory have developed a new mouse model that reveals how patterning and developmental proteins can influence cervical vertebrae formation.\nThe mouse model uses a gene suppression technique that induces skeletal formation. The mice and their offspring appear normal but have striking cervical vertebrae formation. Yang’s new gene suppression technique offers benefits, in this case, over the mouse model generated by complete gene removal (knockout mice), which cause mice to die shortly after birth.\nYang’s laboratory has been studying myostatin, a protein playing a dominant role in reducing muscle mass. By genetically blocking the function of myostatin by its partial DNA sequences, mice were developed with 40 percent more muscle mass. Yang’s graduate student Zicong Li, the first author of the publication, hypothesized that this gene suppression strategy would also work to stimulate skeletal development by inhibiting growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), a similar protein to myostatin, and produce live animals. Previously, the mice with complete removal of the GDF11 gene or knockout mice died shortly after birth. In collaboration with Dr. Stefan Moisyadi’s laboratory in the UH Institute of Biogenesis Research, they generated the transgenic mice by using a new single plasmid system of piggyBac transgene delivery, which offers greater transposition rates and precision.\nThe original research article is titled, “Transgenic Over-Expression of Growth Differentiation Factor 11 Propeptide in Skeleton Results in Transformation of the Seventh Cervical Vertebra into a Thoracic Vertebra.” The publication is available online at http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mrd.21252\/full.\nWork was supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Institutes of Health.\nThe College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR), established in 1907 as the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, is the founding college of the University of Hawai‘i.

    "GPT_Result":"Researchers at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa have created new methods that may greatly affect research on congenital cervical vertebrae problems. In the main article of the November issue of Molecular Reproduction and Development, researchers studied cervical vertebrae issues in humans, which can cause nerve issues and increase the chance of stillbirth in women. Research on abnormal vertebrae development has been hard because there are no lab animals similar to humans and there are limits on research with human subjects. Dr. Jinzeng Yang, who is a molecular biologist in the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources’ Department of Human Nutrition, Food and Animal Sciences, led the research. Researchers from Yang’s lab created a new mouse model that shows how certain proteins can affect cervical vertebrae development. The mouse model uses a method that turns off certain genes to form the skeleton. The mice seem normal but have unusual cervical vertebrae formation. Yang’s gene suppression method has benefits over another method where genes are completely removed, which causes mice to die soon after birth. Yang’s lab has been researching myostatin, a protein that reduces muscle mass. By stopping myostatin with part of its DNA, mice were made with 40% more muscle. Yang’s student Zicong Li, who is the first author, thought that stopping a similar protein, GDF11, would help skeleton growth and produce live mice.

    "Article":"Flint Mobile, a mobile payments startup that, unlike Square or PayPal Here, uses the phone’s camera instead of a dongle to “scan” credit and debit cards, announced this morning an add-on in Series B funding from Verizon Investments, the investing arm of Verizon Communications. This brings Flint’s total Series B raise to date to $8 million.\nThe company had previously announced $6 million in Series B funding led by Digicel Group with SVG Partners, Storm Ventures, and True Ventures also participating. In 2012, it had raised $3 million, also from Storm and True Ventures.\nThe Verizon investment is interesting, given that Flint already saw funding from Digicel, a wireless service provider with networks across the Caribbean and the South Pacific. Though the company isn’t discussing its roadmap in detail, it would say that the additional funding from Verizon will help with continued product development and customer acquisition.\n“Mobile operators seem to appreciate our unique focus to offer full mobility for businesses and are interested in pure digital app models to drive innovation and scale,” says Greg Goldfarb, co-founder and CEO of Flint Mobile. “Based on their day-in, day-out business operations, they see the distribution and adoption challenges posed by hardware accessories first hand,” he adds.\nLike its dongle-based competition, Flint’s mobile payments application for both iOS and Android, is designed for use by merchants and other businesses that operate out of the traditional retail environment, but still need a way to process credit and debit card transactions, handle invoices, send out customer receipts and more. The company now goes a step further, allowing its business users to access cash and checks, too, in the latest release, also out today.\nThe update, arriving first for iOS users, allows merchants to send invoices to customers who can then pay online, from their mobile or tablet computer, without waiting for a check or bank transfer. Flint can also track overdue invoices, and send reminders.\nAnother new feature involves Apple’s Passbook. Flint merchants can now create customized coupons within the app or merchant portal, which can be emailed to customers who then add the coupons to Passbook. The feature is available at no extra charge. Merchants can later scan their Passbook coupons to redeem. Those customers without Passbook can instead redeem their coupons via a QR code received via email. And merchants can send out reminders to their customer base via email before coupons are set to expire.\nFlint has been updated to handle multiple items, custom payment amounts, and the application of discounts to transactions, too.\nAndroid users currently can take advantage of the invoicing option through the merchant portal online, but the other new features will arrive on the Android mobile platform in the near future, the company says.\nThe service is competitive on fees when compared with the competition. For example, while Square charges a reasonable 2.75 percent per swipe and PayPal Here is 2.7 percent, Flint reduces that to 1.95 percent for Visa and MasterCard debit transactions, then increases it to 2.95 percent for credit cards. However, the company doesn’t currently support AmEx and Discover, while others do.\nIn addition to its lower debit-card fees, Flint has aimed to differentiate itself by offering other features like its social marketing tools, which allow businesses to generate Facebook referrals via its emailed receipts where customers are invited to leave a review and like a Facebook page.\nThe company today has seen around 200,000 customer installs to date, the majority of which are on iOS, as Android was released just this October. That’s up from the 150,000 installs announced around the same time. Since Q1 2013, transaction volume has growth by 14x or more, according to Goldfarb, and the average transaction amount has consistently been around $100, which reflects its service-oriented merchant user base.\nCustomers on Flint tend to include beauty and fitness services, specialty contractors, photography and local media, healthcare services, pro services (consultants, attorneys, accountants, I.T. services), recreation and tour guides, and direct sales (Mary Kay, Scentsy, etc.) – businesses which are drawn to Flint, says Goldfarb, because there’s no need to acquire hardware in order to get started accepting transactions.\n",

    "Article":"KABUL (Reuters) - Enayatullah Balegh is a professor at Kabul University and preaches on Fridays in the largest mosque in central Kabul, where he advocates jihad, or holy war, against foreigners who desecrate Islam.\nAfter a fundamentalist U.S. pastor presided over the burning of a copy of the Koran last month, there has been a growing perception among ordinary people that many of the foreigners in Afghanistan belong in just one category: the infidels.\n“The international community and the American government is responsible for this gravest insult to Muslims,” Balegh told Reuters in the blue-and-white tiled Hazrat Ali mosque.\n“I tell my students to wage jihad against all foreigners who desecrate our religious values. We have had enough.”\nProtests in Kabul against the Koran-burning have not become violent but there are many other mullahs in the overcrowded capital whose sermons are filled with criticism of the foreigners fighting and working in Afghanistan.\nIn Kabul’s northwest, firebrand Habibullah Asaam warns his congregation that all contact with non-Muslims is dangerous.\n“The Jews and crusaders can never be friends of Muslims, they are the despoilers of our society and culture,” he said during Friday sermons. Worshippers cried “Allahu Akbar” -- God is greatest -- in response.\n“Those who want them here are cowardly Muslims. Women avoid wearing veils, men chase fashion and show off, it’s all because of the foreigners,” he said.\nWith few Dari or Pashto-speaking foreigners in the country, the messages broadcast from mosques by loudspeakers often pass unnoticed by the people they are condemning.\nBut the extent and impact of anti-Western sentiment was brought into stark relief last week when a protest in normally peaceful Mazar-i-Sharif city in the north ended with the frenzied killing of seven foreign U.N. workers.\nThe demonstrators had spent hours listening to incendiary preaching from outspoken clerics like Abdul Rahoof Tawana, who told worshippers “we must avenge the burning of the Koran.”\nAfter the attack, the provincial governor urged imams to avoid talking about politics and ordered police to round up audio tapes containing “hate” speeches.\nDEEP INFLUENCE\nIn a deeply religious country where most men go to Friday prayers every week, sermons are a critical part of efforts to battle insurgents who have emerged from religious schools and mosques, and usually claim the religious high ground.\nWhile there is no formal hierarchy like Christian churches, the government does have some leverage over the imams.\nIt pays the salaries of many of them, President Hamid Karzai can count many powerful clerics among his senior officials and advisers -- Tawana is a member of Afghanistan’s national ulema, or council of senior clerics -- and the Religious Affairs Ministry gives speech notes to some imams.\n“Sometimes mullahs preach beyond whatever we want but there is no resources to control all mosques in the country,” Israr-ul-Haq, a deputy for the department of Mosques and Other Holy Sites, told Reuters.\nHe said there are about 160,000 mosques in the country and only 3,000 of them are registered with the government. Others are built by the people and their imams are fed and supported by that neighborhood, he said.\n“Mullahs have their own problems. If they speak against government policies, they are either harassed or detained by security forces,” Israr-ul-Haq said. “If they speak in favor of the government, then they are killed by insurgents.”\nKarzai does not seem to have the appetite or influence to face down powerful clerics, and it is hard to follow the contents of sermons in thousands of smaller mosques scattered in remote towns and villages across the country.\nIn rural areas where the Taliban are most active, Friday sermons are often in favor of the insurgency.\nKhan Mohammad, an influential elder in southern Helmand province, said insurgents order imams to condemn NATO troops as “foreign invaders” and the government as a puppet regime.\nAmong both those who were far away, and those who joined the Mazar riots but not the killing, there were many who did not condemn the violence. And although insurgents played a key role, it was ordinary protesters who overwhelmed security in the United Nations’ Mazar compound and helped hunt down the victims.\nBillions of dollars and nearly 10 years into the war, where diplomats point to schools, clinics and an army rebuilt with Western help, the fury that can drive or condone that kind of killing is something many Westerners do not want to look into.\nAnti-Western sentiment is strong in Afghanistan, which is traditionally conservative, deeply religious and suspicious of outsiders. The welcome foreign troops got from many parts of the country in 2001 has slowly soured.\n“There is a lot of anger after years in which Western military operations have caused an accumulation of civilian casualty cases,” wrote Thomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts’ Network, in an article on the killing.\nThe affluent lives of many Westerners and officials perceived as corrupt does not help. Ordinary citizens see little benefit from the billions of aid dollars and suffer regular human rights abuses, adding to frustrations.\n“As if air strikes on civilians, violence and bloodshed was not enough, now they have burned the Koran,” said Tawab Rustami, a 24-year-old university student.\n“The conflict is because of the foreigners, it is better for them to leave before things get worse,” he said.\n",

In a unanimous decision, the five-member Federal Communications Commission (search) said the segment \"simply is not graphic or explicit enough to be indecent under our standard.\"\nA spokesman for ABC sports, Mark Mandel, said the company wouldn't comment.\nThe segment that aired last November showed Sheridan in a locker room wearing only a towel and provocatively asking the Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver to skip the game for her. She then dropped the towel and leaped into Owens' arms.\nOnly the upper back of the \"Desperate Housewives\" star was exposed and no foul language was used — in fact, the scene was no racier than what's routinely seen on soap operas.

    "Article":"Twitter Facebook Google+ WhatsApp LinkedIn Pinterest Email\nThough Trump approved a $717 billion NDAA budget for 2019, full funding approval will have to wait until Congress passes the 2019 government budget. As it stands, however, the bill promises to make helicopters a key element in the United State’s defense strategy. With a particular emphasis on anti-submarine technology, these helicopters also represent a sustainable approach to defense based on current military equipment holdings.\nHelicopters Meet Submarines\nWhile helicopters are often seen as primarily transport vehicles, ideal for accessing areas without airport access, from a military perspective they’re capable of much more. Specifically, when it comes to hunting enemy submarines, helicopters are ideal weapons because they can typically get closer to the water level to detect submarines and they also operate from ship-borne bases. If they don’t sink the submarine, their own base could go down.\nThe US military is especially concerned about Russian submarine warfare at present; in fact, all of NATO is concerned about the Russian submarine threat. Luckily, due to improvements made to the systems a few years ago, US helicopters are now designed to track Russian and Chinese submarines. NATO parties have also spent more time practicing submarine tracking and targeting in recent years.\nFurther Advances Expected\nIn addition to the improvements made to military helicopters several years ago, the Navy is also scheduled to begin mid-life improvements on anti-submarine warfare equipment beginning in FY 2020. Such improvements will draw on recent technological advances such as Doppler navigation, which will replace earlier systems on the Apache Longbow GPS and INS. Such integrated systems are similar enough to prior GPS systems to minimize training costs and also work with existing communications systems – and like other US military technology, it’s likely to be in demand on the international market.\nCompeting National Interests\nOne major concern regarding improved military technology is the fact that very few of these equipment changes are secret in today’s marketplace, and that means other countries want to invest in the same equipment. India, for example, is interested in purchasing MH-60 Romeos, submarine hunting helicopters used by the US military, while the 2019 NDAA actually contained wording prohibiting the US military from doing business with Chinese telecom giant ZTE, before Trump announced the ban would be lifted. When it comes to security and military equipment, secrecy is a thing of the past, and that’s transforming how we prepare for war.\nOther Helicopter Advances\nIn addition to submarine hunting technology, US military helicopters will likely see other technological advances in 2019-2020, including introduction of new self-flying technology that’s been in the works for the past four years, better obstacle avoidance using LIDAR, and tools to prevent helicopter crashes. These new tools are all designed around what the Army calls “mission adaptive autonomy,” which essentially enables the aircraft to take over basic flight mechanisms when the human pilot is needed to perform more complex tasks, such as transporting injured soldiers or providing ground support.\nHelicopters rarely get the level of attention that fighter planes do in conversations about military spending, but from a defense perspective they’re equally important, and the 2019 NDAA makes that clear. By prioritizing advancements for existing helicopter technology, the forthcoming military budget should keep costs down while also providing the military with the tools needed to protect our country.\nRelated Content\nShop Google\n",

If the helicopter does not stop the submarine, their own base could be at risk.\n\nThe US military is worried about Russian submarines now; all of NATO is worried about Russia's submarines.

These tools follow the Army's idea of \"mission adaptive autonomy,\" which lets the helicopter handle basic flying while the pilot focuses on complex tasks, like helping injured soldiers or supporting ground troops.\n\nHelicopters often do not get as much attention as fighter planes in military spending talks, but they are just as important for defense. The 2019 NDAA shows that clearly by focusing on improving helicopter technology, so the upcoming military budget should control costs and give the military tools to protect the country. \n\nRelated Content\nShop Google",

    "Article":"The awareness day on rheumatoid arthritis disease organised by the Kuwait Association of Rheumatology on 1 February 2014 at the 360 Mall in Kuwait was hailed as a big success following the strong and positive response from the huge crowd that gathered at the venue.\nWith an aim raising further awareness about the disease to as many people as possible, the one-day event held from 3 to 7 pm, which was open to the public, clearly achieved such goal as participants expressed positive reviews on the event and went home better informed about the subject. Aside from the huge crowd, also present were officials and representatives of the Ministry of Health of Kuwait as well as corporate sponsors who were likewise all praises on the success of the event.\nA brief program ushered in the event as the presence of officials and VIPs from the Ministry of Health, the association and the sponsors were acknowledged. Following a brief message from the minister, Prof. Adel Al Awadhi, MD, FRCPC, FACP, FACR; Professor of Medicine and Rheumatology; Consultant Physician and Rheumatologist Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University; Head of Rheumatic Disease Unit, Amiri Hospital; and President of Kuwait Association of Rheumatology also delivered his speech.\nDue to the significance of the event, strong support also came from some of the biggest names in pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, such as Newbridge Pharmaceuticals – a first-in-class, venture-backed specialty therapeutics company; Abbvie – a global biopharmaceutical company; Roche – a pioneering innovator of products and services in healthcare; and Pfizer – the world’s largest research-based pharmaceutical company. After the brief opening ceremony, participants were then guided into special areas for the public to get general information about rheumatoid arthritis disease. There, they also learned how the disease can be discovered and get early treatment.\nAnother area focused on patients already inflicted with rheumatoid arthritis disease, where experts provided further information on how to control their disease in a better way. Being a fun-filled yet highly educational and informative event, a special area was also designated for kids. There was also a photo wall and four major raffle draws with valuable gifts for lucky participants.\n“We are extremely delighted that such an important event that is aimed at further educating the public about rheumatoid arthritis disease received such a tremendous response from the public,” Prof. Adel Al Awadhi said. “At the same time, the success of this event would not have been made possible without the full support and assistance of the Ministry of Health of Kuwait as well as our generous sponsors. This kind of events must be sustained in order to reach out to even more people in Kuwait,” he added. “Thus, with the unwavering commitment of the association towards such endeavour, and encouraged by the strong and continued support and assistance from the government of Kuwait, specifically through the Ministry of Health, as well as the sponsors, we are definitely looking forward to organising and holding another one soon,” he concluded.\nRheumatoid arthritis happens to around 1% of the adult population, and more common to women on a ratio of 3:1. Further study shows that 90% of patients inflicted with the disease have developed some form of disability within two decades of onset if they do not receive proper medical treatment. As an inflammatory, autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis is a condition whereby the body starts attacking its joints causing pain, inflammation and joint stiffness especially in the morning. In the long-term, this disease causes damage to the cartilage, tendons and ligaments, and can even wear away the ends of bones thereby causing joint deformity and disability.\nFor more information, please contact:\nAmna Al Jarery\/ Laila Al Tarawnah\nAction PR Group\nTel: +9652491561\n",
